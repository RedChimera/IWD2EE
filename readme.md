# Icewind Dale 2: Enhanced Edition

Icewind Dale 2: Enhanced Edition is a compilation of tweaks and fixes for Icewind Dale 2, enhancing the game in a variety of ways. Classes, spells, items, creatures, and encounters are made more interesting. IWD2EE changes over 300 spells and over 1,000 items, and it adds over 30 new spells, over 120 new items, and several NPCs that can join the party. The mod fixes many of the big issues with the original Icewind Dale 2: you no longer have to solve tedious, cryptic puzzles to complete certain areas, enemies in Heart of Fury Mode are empowered in interesting ways rather than just having lots of HP, and you can revise the experience system so you won't get zero experience for killing enemies late in the game.

Installation:

1. Unzip all files into your IWD2 folder.
2. Double-click on the Setup-iwd2ee.exe application.
3. The WeiDu window will pop up. Follow the prompt and WeiDu will install the mod on your game. This can also reinstall or uninstall the mod.
4. In the IWD2 folder will appear a new program: IWD2EE.exe.

## Class Revisions

This component revises the game's classes to make warriors and rogues much more viable. This component is most balanced when combined with the Spell Revisions component.

Barbarians: Barbarian rage now grants immunity to fear, hopelessness, stun, paralysis, sleep, and unconsciousness. Also, Barbarians start gaining damage resistance at level 2 rather than level 11, and their damage resistance from their class is doubled if they're wearing medium armor (hide armor or chain mail). Barbarian Rage now keeps improving after level 20.

Bards: Bard songs should be more useful now. They're also spread out over more levels and scale with levels so bards no longer reach their peak at level 11. The songs can stack, but only if multiple bards sing at the same time.

Level 1: The Tale of Currant Strongheart: +1 to hit and damage and immunity to fear and hopelessness. Gains another +1 to hit and damage at levels 10, 25 and 40.

Level 3: The Song of Kaudies: All allies are immune to harmful sound-based spells and abilities.

Level 5: Tymora's Melody: +1 luck, +2 to saving throws and rogue skills. Gives another +1 to luck and +2 to saving throws and rogue skills at levels 15 and 35.

Level 9: The Siren's Yearning: All enemies must make a Will save or be stunned for 1 round or until they take damage. The save DC is equal to the bard's level. This song also imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to Will saves for 10 rounds, every round.

Level 13: The War Chant of Sith: +2 generic armor bonus, physical damage resistance of 3/-, and 3 HP healed every round. Increases to +4 AC, 6/- damage resistance, and 6 HP healed every round at level 25.

Level 20: The Ballad of Three Heroes: +5 spell resistance, 5/- resistance to all forms of magical damage, and the effects of the Tale of Curran Strongheart, Tymora's Melody, and the War Chant of Sith. Increases to +10 spell resistance and 10/- resistance to magical damage at level 28.

Creature Revisions also makes it so enemies early on use more sound-based spells and abilities (such as harpy wails in Chapter 1), which makes the Song of Kaudies more useful.

Clerics: Clerics, druid, and mages all gain spell slots at the same rate. Spontaneous casting scales beyond level 4 (you can now cast Healing Circle, Heal, Greater Restoration, and Mass Heal via spontaneous casting).

Druids: Druids get a new set of shapeshifting forms. The abilities of each form scale with the druid's level.

Level 5: Winter Wolf
Level 7: Polar Bear
Level 9: Giant Viper
Level 11: Salamander or Frost Salamander
Level 13: Shambling Mound
Level 15: Fire, Water, Earth or Air Elemental
Level 30: Black Dragon (Dragon Shape)

The druid shapeshifting feats are also changed. They now allow druids to shapeshift into Blink Dogs, Rhinocerous Beetles, and a swarm of insects as in the Creeping Doom spell.

Rogues: Rogues get +1 luck every 5 levels. They won't have the sustained damage output a warrior has, but they'll be able to land some very wicked sneak attacks (luck in IWD2 increases the chance of a critical hit).

Monks: Monks now get much faster and more accurate unarmed attacks, and their attack damage progresses more logically. Their base damage caps at 1d8+5, but they start with 2 attacks per round and gain an additional attack per round every 3 levels (up to 18 attacks per round at level 49). Their Deflect Arrows ability now lets them take no damage from the first missile attack that would hit them each round. Wholeness of Body now restores HP equal to the character's monk level * their Wisdom bonus, and can be used once per 7 levels. Quivering Palm can affect enemies higher level than the monk, and monks gain an additional use of Quivering Palm every 6 levels after level 15. Monks also get Abundant Step at level 10, a teleportation effect.

In addition, monk orders no longer limit multiclassing, and they have extra abilities.

Monk of the Old Order:
2nd level: The monk now adds their Wisdom bonus again to the DC of Stunning Attack.
18th level: The monk now adds their Wisdom bonus again to the DC of Quivering Palm.

Monk of the Broken Ones:
2nd level: The monk gains one use of Lay on Hands per day. Any level that would give the monk a use of Wholeness of Body instead gives them another use of Lay on Hands. When used by a Monk of the Broken Ones, Lay on Hands restores the same amount of HP as Wholeness of Body (monk level * Wisdom bonus) but can be used on other creatures as well.
6th level: The monk gains 2/- resistance to all physical damage. Another 1/- resistance is gained every 4 levels thereafter.

Monk of the Dark Moon:
2nd level: The monk gains a sneak attack bonus of 1d6. For every 4 additional monk levels after level 2, the monk gains another 1d6 sneak attack damage.

Fighters: Fighters get +1 to damage every 5 levels and +5% critical hit chance every 10 levels, and now the fighter-exclusive Weapon Specialization feats give +5 to hit and damage. All warriors get better saving throws and stronger attacks.

Rangers: Rangers get more spell slots, and they get them at lower levels. They can gain the feats Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot at lower levels than other classes, and they can gain a second rank in those feats for another attack per round. They are also able to use Set Natural Snare every 6 levels, which snares enemies for 5 rounds on a failed Reflex save. Set Natural Snare is much more effective than in the original game; the save DC now improves by 1 for every level and will work reliably even in Heart of Fury mode.

Paladins: Paladins get more spell slots, and they get them at lower levels. Paladins get an additional casting of Lay on Hands every 5 levels. Smite Evil is more powerful, and they get an additional casting of Smite Evil every 10 levels.

In addition, paladin orders no longer limit multiclassing, and they have extra abilities.

Paladin of Ilmater:
2nd level: The paladin can cast Shield Other (which halves the damage an ally takes, causing the paladin to take the other half) at will.
6th level: The paladin's healing spells and abilities heal 50% more hit points if used on an ally other than the paladin.
11th level: The bonus to healing spells and abilities is increased from 50% to 100%.

Paladin of Helm:
2nd level: While using the Guard action, the paladin and all allies within 20 feet gain a +2 AC bonus.
6th level: The AC bonus from using the Guard action increases to +4.
11th level: While using the Guard action, the paladin can see through illusions as per True Sight.

Paladin of Mystra:
2nd level: The paladin gains one rank in Armored Arcana, reducing their arcane spell failure by 35%.
6th level: The paladin gains two more ranks in Armored Arcana, reducing their arcane spell failure by a total of 105% (allowing them to cast arcane spells with no chance of failure while wearing the heaviest armor and shields).
11th level: All fire, cold, electricity, acid, and magic damage dealt by the paladin is increased by 20%. This stacks with feats like Spirit of Flame. This bonus applies to both spells like Fireball and abilities like Smite Evil.

Sorcerers: Sorcerers will no longer hit their peak at level 20 and then experience near-zero growth. They get slightly slower spell growth and slightly slower access to new spell picks.

Class Revisions also adds over 30 new skills to the game and modifies several existing skills to make them more useful.

## Looser Alignment Restrictions for Classes

Even IWD2's very broad class system can be restrictive in some ways, mostly in the lawful/chaotic axis. This component loosens a few of the restrictions, allowing certain classes to be compatible with more alignments:

Bards can be any alignment besides Lawful Neutral (previously could not be any lawful alignment)
Monks of the Old Order can be any non-chaotic alignment
Monks of the Broken Ones can be Neutral Good
Monks of the Dark Moon can be Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, and Neutral Evil
Paladins of Ilmater and Mystra can be Neutral Good
Paladins of Helm can be Lawful Neutral
Rogues can be Lawful Good

## Spell Revisions

This component significantly strengthens many underpowered spells. It also switches some spells to lower or higher levels and grants some spells to classes that previously could not cast them. Here are the main changes:

- Over 90 new spells are added to the game. These include unused spells like Dimension Door, spells from other games like Mantle and True Strike, as well as unusual ones like Identify Creature (a divination spell that tells you the stats of the target creature) and Auril's Blessing (which increases the power of your cold spells).

- Cleric domains have better spell choices. If a spell is in-theme with the kit (e.g. Moonblade and Wall of Moonlight for priests of Selune), they can cast it at a particularly low level as a domain spell.

- Certain spells are available to more classes. Rangers and Paladins have much better spell choices. Spells that create magical weapons or give combat bonuses can be cast as lower-level spells by Rangers or Paladins than by Druids or Clerics (e.g. Rangers can cast Fire Seeds as a 4th-level spell, and Paladins can cast Spiritual Weapon as a 1st-level spell and Holy Power as a 3rd-level spell).

- Magical weapons like Flame Blade and Decastave have been improved. Most of them gain bonuses from Strength and proficiency (even ones that deal non-physical damage). Saving throws on magical weapons and touch attacks (e.g. Snakebite poison, Slay Living instant death) now have DCs that scale with the character's spellcasting ability and Spell Focus bonuses.

- Spells that weaken a creature rather than disabling it have a higher DC or no save at all (e.g. Deafness has no save since it simply gives 20% spell failure).

## Spell Focus Feats for All Schools

In the unmodded game, spellcasters could only choose Spell Focus to empower Evocation, Necromancy, Transmutation, and Enchantment spells. This component expands those four feats to apply to the other four spell schools as well. The new feats are:

Spell Focus: Evocation/Conjuration
Spell Focus: Enchantment/Illusion
Spell Focus: Necromancy/Divination
Spell Focus: Transmutation/Abjuration

## Item Revisions

Normally, Icewind Dale 2's items are balanced terribly. There are just a few good items towering over hundreds of almost useless magic items (e.g. items that just provide +1 Hide skill or 1/- Spell Resistance). It's not even a low-magic game: one gets tons of magic items, but most of them suck.

Item Revisions enhances most of the magical items in Icewind Dale 2, giving them a much larger variety of useful abilities. The purpose is primarily to empower weak items rather than to weaken strong items. Overall, the total number of magical items you obtain as loot in the game won't change much, but those items are more likely to be useful.

Item Revisions also adds many new items to the random loot tables, including powerful armor, shields, rings, amulets, and ammunition. 

## Creature Revisions

This component enhances creatures and encounters throughout the game. Here are the main changes:

- Spellcasters are given better AI and new spell selections, including some of the new spells from Spell Revisions. They start combat with buffs on. They shouldn't be quite as tough as Sword Coast Stratagems spellcasters, though.
- Enemy clerics now use domain spells. Even clerics of enemy-only deities cast domain spells (e.g. priests of Auril have spells like Ice Storm, while priests of Xvim have acid spells).
- Enemies use more sensible items and attacks. Aurilite rangers shoot frost arrows, mind flayers drain Intelligence on hit, and large creatures have longer reach on their attacks.
- On Heart of Fury Mode, enemies are stronger in a variety of ways. Monsters' innate abilities have higher save DCs and/or deal more damage. Spellcasters cast higher-level spells than they do on normal difficulty settings.

Fixes:

- Harpies in Chapter 1 use their wail.
- Yuan-ti Half-breed Sorceresses in the battle for Kuldahar now cast spells.
- On Heart of Fury Mode, enemy monks have higher-level monk fists to reflect the fact that they are higher-level. 
- On Heart of Fury Mode, creatures summoned by enemies now gain Heart of Fury Mode bonuses.

## Better XP Progression

In most RPGs, you gain levels at a roughly constant level over the course of the game. In IWD2, though, you gain XP and levels slower and slower as you progress in the game, which is the biggest reason why the late game is so much less fun than the early game. This is because many enemies are rigged to be a lower challenge rating than their actual level. By the time you're in the Severed Hand, you might be fighting critters that are level 17 but have a challenge rating of 9!

This component fixes that. There are two install options. The first option sets all creatures' challenge rating equal to their level, which results in extremely fast leveling as the game progresses. The second option, which is the recommended version, sets CR to slightly below their level after level 9. Neither option will affect early game enemies much, but midgame and endgame enemies will now grant XP appropriate to the challenge they pose.

## Faster Targos

This component allows the player to skip most of the Targos questline. The first time you speak with Shawford Crale, you can trigger the goblin invasion with Vghotan, Ghotrag, and Caballus by saying "Did you hear that?" midway through the dialogue.

## Faster Horde Fortress

This component rigs the front gate of the Horde Fortress so that you can force it open and attack the fortress head on rather than sneaking through the tunnels. It also adds additional ways to get inside Guthma's cabin.

## Faster Ice Temple

Getting through the Ice Temple is one of the slowest parts of IWD2, with lots of disconnected plot triggers and quest items. This component makes it so some of the locked doors in the temple that normally require keys or the lightning machine to open are now either open by default or pickable. This component also allows you to skip the whole area by tearing down the wall through brute force. If you deal enough damage to the Ice Wall Fault in the northwest corner of the exterior map (the one with Sherincal and the Remorhazes), the wall will collapse and you can proceed to the next area. Destroying the wall is extremely difficult, however, as the wall has tremendous damage resistances, lots of HP, and deals cold damage whenever it is struck.

## Faster Wandering Village

This component lets you delve all the way through the Fell Wood and fight the Will o' Wisps the first time you go there, rather than having to go through it three times for the three quests.

The component also allows you to skip all of the Wandering Village questlines and the Fell Wood Maze by going straight to the exit. Enter the Fell Wood where the spirit greets you, choose the east exit to the treant area, and the exit to the next area will already be open.

It is still possible to complete all of the Wandering Village quests with this component installed.

## Faster Black Raven Monastery

This component allows you to skip the Black Raven Monastery trials without having to kill the monks. The locked door in the monastery basement can now be picked.

## Faster Underdark

This component lets you skip the Viciscamera questline. You should be able to force open the doors to the mind flayer city and proceed without doing any chores for Malavon.

## Faster Dragon's Eye

Dragon's Eye and the time paradox questline in Lord Pyros' Domain have long been the low point of IWD2, with massive amounts of backtracking, numerous plot triggers with few clues to indicate where you're supposed to go, and very little reward for the immense amount of time you have to invest in the game just to get through it. This component makes two of the mandatory side quests in Dragon's Eye optional.

Opening the door in the third floor of Dragon's Eye no longer requires you to put poison in the four pools in the area; you just have to kill Thorasskus. In addition, you can pass under the Eye of Sseth without being a histachii.

## Faster Severed Hand

The Severed Hand can also take a fair amount of time, and while it's not nearly as monotonous as Dragon's Eye or the Ice Temple, some parts of it can still be very slow. This component adds Ruinlord Argos Val to Isair and Madae's throne room. If you have a very high Bluff score, you can convince him to introduce you to Isair and Madae without having to do any of the other quests in the Severed Hand.

This component also makes it so you do not need to defeat Iyachtu Xvim before going to the final boss (though in this case you'll have to fight the glabrezus in the final battle).

## Alternative Dragon's Eye

This component simplifies the final area of Dragon's Eye. Rather than having to go through a long time travel quest, you just fight one battle to prevent Izbelah from casting Temporal Stasis. The component changes some dialogs in Chapter 5 to make it clear why you're fighting Izbelah.

## Add more scrolls to the game

This component adds relatively high-level mage scrolls to various spell vendors, including Elytharra, Zack Boosenberry, Suoma, Bered, and Sheemish. A solo wizard or a wizard in HoF mode will be able to learn high-end spells and keep pace with a sorcerer. This isn't too extreme: early-game vendors might have a couple of scrolls at 5th-7th level, but they won't have tons of 9th-level scrolls.

## Revised Creature Resistances and Immunities

This component revises the resistances of some creatures to be more reasonable. For example, slimes in Dragon's Eye aren't completely immune to physical damage, and iron golems and will o' wisps aren't completely immune to magic (they still have high spell resistance, though).

Elementals now have regular elemental immunities rather than undead immunities. Fiends now have regular fiendish immunities (e.g. immunity to poison) rather than undead immunities.

Trolls no longer fall down and have to be finished off by fire or acid; instead they regenerate faster and have more HP but take significantly more damage from fire and acid.

## More Accurate Saving Throws for Enemies

This component adjusts all enemy saving throws in the game, making them roughly equal to the player's saving throws at the same level. Thus, a level 10 enemy fighter will have similar saving throws to a level 10 fighter in the party.

## Revise Critical Hit Immunity

The vanilla game gives out immunity to critical hits to enemies that shouldn't have it, including fiends and certain random enemies. This component has two options: either you can give critical hit immunity to all undead, constructs, objects, elementals and oozes and remove it for all other creatures, or you can make all creatures vulnerable to critical hits.

## Better Racial Enemies for Rangers

In the vanilla game, there were a lot of racial enemy choices that simply weren't very useful. Getting bonuses against yuan-ti and undead was simply better than getting bonuses against bugbears and hook horrors. This component gives the player the ability to choose from a new set of racial enemies:

Giant Insects
Giant Arachnids
Demons
Goblinoids
Giants
Amorphous Beings
Constructs
Humans
Animals
Undead
Aberrations
Underdark Aberrations
Yuan-ti
Elementals
Trolls
Dragons

## Cosmetic Tweaks

Currently, this component lets any race choose any of the available colors on character creation.

## More Persuasion Options

These components add more opportunities in the game to use Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate, usually to skip a battle.

## NPC Core

This component allows several existing NPCs to join the party: the fighter Reig, the rogue Black Geoffrey, the diviner Veira, the cleric Emma Moonblade, the troll Vrek Vileclaw, the goblin Vunarg, the rogue/illusionist Zack Boosenburry, the abishai Xhaan, the sorcerer Pairi, and the monk Sersa. 

## NPCs gain experience upon joining to match the party's experience

This component lets NPCs from the NPC Core component start with experience to match the party. There are two subcomponents. The first one makes NPCs start with the average experience of the rest of the party members. The second one makes them start with a fifth of the total experience of the party (this way, a small, high level party won't recruit high level NPCs).

## Cosmetic improvements to the GUI and New loading screens

This component currently adds a new main menu screen and new chapter screens. There are no new buttons, but the GUI should look better.

## Looping Main Theme

Normally IWD2's main theme does not loop. After 1 minute, it ends and you spend the rest of character creation with no music playing. This component edits the main theme to play repeatedly.

## Revised Battle Square

To get all the rewards for the Battle Square, one normally has to fight 25 battles per rank, to a total of 250 battles. Even if the party members are powerful enough to win all the battles, this is still very tedious.

This component makes it so one only has to beat a rank once (with 3 or more squares) to get the main reward for the rank. To get all the rewards, it will only take 30 battles rather than 250.

## Minor Damage Resistance for Armor and Shields

Inspired by Weimer's similar component from IWD2-Ease, this component patches every armor and shield in the game so they give physical damage resistance equal to half their Armor Class bonus, rounded down. 

## Race Revisions

Race Revisions gives some new abilities to certain races, to make them fit their archetypes better. For example, lightfoot halflings gain their Dexterity modifier (if higher than their Strength modifier) to the damage of slings and other throwing weapons. Rock gnomes gain a bonus to Intelligence rather than Constitution.

## Revise racial level adjustment/ECL

This component makes it so rather than certain subraces being one or more "levels behind" other characters, they get a certain penalty to XP. In practice, this means that these subraces don't level up that much slower than other characters early on, though at very high levels they lag behind a bit more.

## Enemies give the same amount of experience regardless of the party's level

This component makes killing enemies give the same amount of experience no matter the party's level. This way, leveling up doesn't come with the dissatifaction of enemies giving less experience, and there's no incentive to delay leveling up to increase experience gain. There are two options: either you can have enemies give experience equal to 25 \* their challenge rating (a six-character party will reach about level 15 by the end of the game), or it can be 35 \* their challenge rating (a six-character party will reach about level 18 by the end of the game).

## Adjust encounter level-scaling

Icewind Dale 2 encounters often have additional enemies for a higher-level party. This component has two options: you can make it so you always fight at least the version of the encounter meant for a medium-level party, or you can make it so you always fight the version meant for a high-level party. The higher-level versions of encounters usually just have a couple more enemies or in some cases have tougher versions of enemies; they aren't impossible for a lower-level party to complete.

## Reduce the HP bonuses of creatures in Heart of Fury Mode

Enemies in Heart of Fury Mode normally have absolutely ridiculous HP: goblins in the prologue have 157 HP, and the frost spiders in Chapter 2 have 452 HP! This component drastically reduces the HP on creatures in Heart of Fury Mode: goblins in the prologue have 13 HP, and the frost spiders have 232 HP. This will make Heart of Fury Mode easier, but also much less tedious (and Creature Revisions makes Heart of Fury Mode more challenging to make up for it).

## Reduce the attack bonuses of creatures in Heart of Fury Mode

Enemies in Heart of Fury Mode have such high attack bonuses that it's near impossible for them to miss except on a 1. This component gives creatures outside the party a -9 attack penalty on Heart of Fury Mode. They will still have higher attack bonuses than they do on the next-hardest difficulty, but it won't be quite as extreme.

## Reduce the Saving Throw bonuses of creatures in Heart of Fury Mode

Early on in Heart of Fury Mode, it can be very difficult to get enemies to fail saving throws if you're starting as a low-level party. This component gives a small saving throw penalty to creatures outside the party on Heart of Fury Mode.

## Remove ability score bonuses of allied summoned creatures in Heart of Fury Mode

In Heart of Fury Mode, allied summoned creatures also get HoF bonuses, and since you reach high level more quickly, summoned creatures can be quite overpowered. This component makes it so summoned creatures don't gain the normal +10 to all ability scores that creatures on Heart of Fury Mode get, unless they are summoned by an enemy.

## Have the party start with more experience on Heart of Fury Mode

The beginning of Heart of Fury Mode is absolutely brutal if you start at level 1 - even with some of those components installed that weaken HoF creatures. This component gives each party member some experience at the start of the game. The experience each character starts with is the same regardless of party size. You have choices of how much experience to start with.

## Reduce the delay after a sneak attack before the creature can be sneak attacked again

Normally once a rogue sneak attacks a creature, that creature becomes immune to sneak attacks for about 3 rounds. This component can either remove that immunity, allowing the creature to be sneak attacked again immediately, or reduce its duration to 1 round.

## Increase the level cap

This component increases the level cap to 40 or to 50 (your choice). You'll only reach such high levels if you're soloing or playing Heart of Fury Mode.

## Always learn spells from scrolls successfully

This component lets all wizards successfully learn spells from scrolls 100% of the time.

## Remove the summoning limit

This component allows you to summon any number of creatures at once.

## Add attacks of opportunity to the game

This component allows characters to make attacks of opportunity in melee under certain conditions: if the enemy steps out of your melee range, if they make a ranged attack, or if they cast a spell. There are two subcomponents: you can make it so only characters with a certain feat can perform attacks of opportunity, or you can allow everyone to make attacks of opportunity. 

## Roll for stats at character creation

This component lets you roll for stats rather than use IWD2's normal point-buy system. There are two subcomponents. The first one doesn't allow you to increment or decrement stats with the plus/minus buttons, but you can choose which ability score each number rolled is assigned to (like in The Temple of Elemental Evil). The second subcomponent lets you use the plus/minus buttons.

Much of the credit for the inspiration for this mod goes to the makers of Light of Selune, IWD2-Ease, and Tactics4IWD2, which provided the groundwork for this mod and the changes it makes. I would also like to thank Firecrow, who provided indispensable feedback and played an instrumental role in inspiring many of the mod's features, and subtledoctor, bubb, and Gwendolyne for providing invaluable technical support during the construction of the mod. Credit goes to Erephine for making the new animations from One Pixel Productions, which have been added to IWD2EE.
