"Круг льда" существовал на средства одного купца из Вотердипа, чьё имя позже было вычеркнуто из хроник Великой башни. По всей видимости, после того, как во время торгового соглашения в Лускане этот купец был сильно унижен (а так же был вынужден за бесценок отдать большую часть своих товаров), он стал одержим идеей стереть Великую башню с лица Фаэруна. Поручив волшебникам в Вотердипе изготовить для него несколько колец, он решил использовать оставшееся у него богатство, чтобы нанять группу из двадцати убийц волшебников для уничтожения магов Великой башни. Эти убийцы должны были самостоятельно отправиться на север и встретиться с торговцем в Лускане.

Иронично, но сам купец никогда не носил ни одного из этих колец, что послужило раскрытию и уничтожению всей организации. Как только этот торговец добрался до Лускана, его разум был прочтён магами-телепатами, а личности всех убийц волшебников установлены. В конечном счёте, все заговорщики были завлечены в смертельные ловушки, где их кольца оказались не в состоянии противостоять призванным монстрам и смертельным стрелам. Говорят, что только одному из этих убийц, Мартеку, удалось выбраться из Великой башни, и найти его так и не удалось, что очень раздражало магов башни.

Как бы то ни было, "Круг льда" был быстро и тихо разгромлён в Лускане, а вот сам купец стал игрушкой магов Великой башни, служа им до самой смерти, после чего его тело было отправлено в лабораторию. Скорее всего, через много лет из его тела сделают левую руку голема из плоти по имени Бок.

Эти маленькие кольца холодного отражения кажутся сделанными изо льда и очень холодны на ощупь. Кроме того, эти кольца может увидеть только волшебник, который знает, где они должны находиться.

Если в вашей группе есть тот, кто считает себя убийцей волшебников, то он может использовать это кольцо по назначению... и при этом не опасаться разделить участь несчастного купца.

Поручив волшебникам в Вотердипе изготовить для него несколько колец, он решил использовать оставшееся у него богатство, чтобы нанять группу из двадцати убийц волшебников для уничтожения магов Великой башни. Эти убийцы должны были самостоятельно отправиться на север и встретиться с торговцем в Лускане.

Был, однако, один убийца волшебников по имени Мартек, который отказался от кольца, предложенного торговцем, и, зная об опасности и коварстве Великой башни, предпочёл заказать другое кольцо у своего союзника-дварфа. Это кольцо должно было обеспечить ему дополнительную защиту против заклинаний и чар. Когда других членов "Круга Льда" начали убивать в Лускане, после того, как Великая башня узнала их личности, Мартек воспользовался силой своего кольца для того, чтобы защититься от колдовства магов башни и сбежал на юг. В конце концов, он вернул кольцо своему союзнику-дварфу, а тот продал его торговцу, направляющемуся в Брин Шандер.

Это кольцо, называемое "Отражение холодной стали" отличается от других колец "Круга Льда" тем, что под его ледяной оболочкой проходит стальной стержень - что неплохо характеризует и самого Мартека.

Однако нападения начали его утомлять, а тролли всё больше наглели.

Потратив несколько месяцев на изучение действия иссушающей магии, призывания элементалей и волшебных методов заморозки, Прашнак осуществил свой эксперимент. Призвав водного элементаля, он испарил из тела несчастного существа часть жидкости и заморозил его. Таким образом он возвёл в окрестностях своего жилища множество ужасных ледяных скульптур. Глуповатые тролли ужасно испугались этих тотемов и, по слухам, вообще сбежали из тех краёв. Увидев, что эксперимент увенчался успехом, Прашнак с новой силой взялся за свои жестокие изыскания и ведёт их по сей день.

@10249    = ~В учениях Камджин-До из Кара-Тура, сохранившихся до наших дней, говорится о том, что настоящий мастер оружия должен полагаться не на кожаные доспехи, кольчугу или панцирь, а на свои отточенные навыки - чтобы его вообще никогда не могли ударить оружием... а это значит, что мастер оружия должен знать движения своего врага, как движения собственной руки. Но это возможно лишь в том случае, если боец способен сохранять сосредоточение на своём враге даже в пылу битвы... Именно с этой целью и были созданы эти простые кожаные наплечники.

Первоначально эти наплечники предназначались для учеников, занимающихся Камджин-До. В сумрачном свете от них исходит мягкое серебристое сияние. Если надеть их на руки, то они обостряют восприятие, позволяя лучше следить за действиями противника. Кроме того, они оказывают успокаивающее действие на разум святого меча. А в тех редких случаях, когда врагу удаётся нанести точный удар, браслеты помогают своему владельцу не обращать внимание на боль (которая называется "отвлекающим фактором" в учении Камджин-До), ибо боль должна принадлежать только противнику.

Многие из этих наплечников были разбросаны по всему Фаэруну после того, как Повелитель Бритв разрушил Камджин-До. Ходят слухи, что даже у самого Повелителя Бритв было подобные наплечники, но их нынешнее местонахождение остаётся загадкой.

Личности тех, кто убил кенсая неизвестны, но в Кара-Туре ходили слухи, что трое святых мечей Камджин-До вернулись из мёртвых, чтобы положить конец преступлениям кенсая-отступника.

Эти некогда простые наплечники сосредоточения, которые носил Повелитель, будучи учеником, запятнались кровью и позором и больше не сияют тем же светом, что и раньше. По мере того, как Повелитель терял своё сосредоточение, его наплечники тлели и гнили на его кровоточащих руках. Тем не менее, даже сейчас они хранят в себе силу, мощь и порочность Повелителя Бритв... делая того, кто их носит, гораздо более смертоносным.

Тем, кто станет носить эти наплечники, никогда не следует забывать об их назначении: нужно оставаться сосредоточенным и помнить об досягаемости врага. Если хранить это в своём сердце, эти наплечники сослужат хорошую службу.

За это изделия пекарни Бэйкеров очень ценили не только в северных городах, но даже в Лускане и Серебристой Луне. Тэмьян же ненавидел помогать отцу - его пекарские достижения служили поводом для насмешек среди волшебников Севера. В конце концов, Тэмьян решил нанять шайку разбойников, чтобы те напали на него и его отца во время их путешествия в Лускан. Юный маг полагал, что налёт испугает отца и отвратит его от мысли основать пекарни по всему Северу.

К сожалению, вместо занятий Тэмьяну частенько приходилось помогать отцу в семейной пекарне. От Тэмьяна требовалось магией сохранять свежесть отцовской выпечки. За это изделия пекарни Бэйкеров очень ценили не только в северных городах, но даже в Лускане и Серебристой Луне. Тэмьян же ненавидел помогать отцу - его пекарские достижения служили поводом для насмешек среди волшебников Севера. В конце концов, Тэмьян решил нанять шайку разбойников, чтобы те напали на него и его отца во время их путешествия в Лускан. Юный маг полагал, что налёт испугает отца и отвратит его от мысли основать пекарни по всему Северу. Но, как известно, жизнь любит вносить свои коррективы - бандиты слишком увлеклись отведённой им ролью. Лишь через несколько недель разведчики Невервинтера нашли останки груза, среди которого были и волшебные наручи Тэмьяна.

Наручи сделаны из сосны и выделанной кожи. Местами они укреплены стальными вставками и почти лишены украшений, если не считать за таковые изящно изогнутый металл.

Однажды, когда Бехем возделывал свою ферму неподалёку от Ручья Мечей, с востока прискакали конные разбойники и потребовали, чтобы он отдал свою землю. Бехем был подавлен горем и не смог ответить им. Главарь разбойник сказал фермеру, что у него есть время до рассвета следующего дня, чтобы освободить землю. Затем разбойники поскакали к другим фермерам и сказали им то же самое. На закате, когда крестьяне освобождали свои дома и готовились к переезду на более защищённые территории, некоторые из них видели силуэт Бехема, который стоял на своём поле с низко опущенной головой, опираясь на мотыгу.

В сумерках, три фермера подошли к полю Бехема и увидели, что фермер спит на своей земле. Ещё более шокирующим было явление женщины, которую посчитали духом Чонтии, обернувшей плащ Бехема вокруг него. Фермеры вернулись к своим семьям и рассказали всем об увиденном. Полные уверенности в том, что Чонтия благословила Бехема за то, что он остался на своей земле, крестьяне собрали свои семьи и отправились обратно на свои фермы. К сожалению, их смелость вернулась к ним слишком поздно. Бехем был убит бандитами за то, что отказался уйти. На глазах у фермеров, из поля, на котором стояли разбойники, вырвались густые лианы. Растительность не только крепко держала бандитов на месте, не давая им пошевелиться, но ещё и била и душила их до потери сознания. Фермеры бросились вперёд и прогнали оставшихся бандитов. И хотя тело Бехема исчезло вместе с лианами, на поле остался его окровавленный, изорванный плащ.

@10331    = ~На фермах в Долинных Землях, расположенных к западу от Лунного Моря, большинство мужчин и женщин, работающих в полях, ведут простой и скромный образ жизни. Именно из такой просто жизни и возникла легенда о Бехеме, фермере из Мглистой Долины. Однако, обстоятельства возникновения этой легенды далеки от обыкновенных. Однажды, когда Бехем возделывал свою ферму неподалёку от Ручья Мечей, с востока прискакали конные разбойники и потребовали, чтобы он отдал свою землю. Бехем был подавлен горем и не смог ответить им. Главарь разбойник сказал фермеру, что у него есть время до рассвета следующего дня, чтобы освободить землю. Затем разбойники поскакали к другим фермерам и сказали им то же самое. На закате, когда крестьяне освобождали свои дома и готовились к переезду на более защищённые территории, некоторые из них видели силуэт Бехема, который стоял на своём поле с низко опущенной головой, опираясь на мотыгу.

В сумерках, три фермера подошли к полю Бехема и увидели, что фермер спит на своей земле. Ещё более шокирующим было явление женщины, которую посчитали духом Чонтии, обернувшей плащ Бехема вокруг него. Фермеры вернулись к своим семьям и рассказали всем об увиденном. Полные уверенности в том, что Чонтия благословила Бехема за то, что он остался на своей земле, крестьяне собрали свои семьи и отправились обратно на свои фермы. К сожалению, их смелость вернулась к ним слишком поздно. Бехем был убит бандитами за то, что отказался уйти. На глазах у фермеров, из поля, на котором стояли разбойники, вырвались густые лианы. Растительность не только крепко держала бандитов на месте, не давая им пошевелиться, но ещё и била и душила их до потери сознания. Фермеры бросились вперёд и прогнали оставшихся бандитов. И хотя тело Бехема исчезло вместе с лианами, на поле остался его окровавленный, изорванный плащ.

И хотя при определённой подготовке волшебники могут обойти преодолеть эти ограничения, большинство из них предпочитает не страдать от громоздких доспехов, а носить зачарованный плащ или кольцо, помогающие отражать удары. Однако, сильный удар меча или меткий выстрел из лука талантливого воителя вполне способен пробить такую защиту.

Священники Мистры, видя дилему, выпавшую на долю волшебников, создали плащи, благословлённые самой богиней магии. Эти плащи наделяют волшебников особым сопротивлением урону, так, что большинство, если не все повреждения, причинённые оружием, сводятся на нет. Кроме того, священники Мистры наделили эти плащи способностью накладывать заклинание "Каменная кожа". Стоит ли говорить о том, что волшебники, у которых были такие плащи, стали чувствовать себя ещё более могучими и практически неуязвимыми.

Орда срубила множество деревьев и разрушила экосистему огромных участков земли, строя свои осадные машины, так что мстители объявили им войну. Несмотря на то, что эти мстители были в конце концов истреблены в битве с кланом орков у Хребта Мира, их плащи сохранились, и время от времени их можно встретить в разных поселениях Севера.

Друид, одетый в такой плащ, получает возможность вызвать опаляющий огонь на любого врага, который нанёс ему урон. Это ослепляло многих врагов... чтобы уже в следующую секунду получить клинком мстителя в горло.

Когда же плащ наконец опустился на землю, его подобрал странствующий друид, который использовал его, чтобы сокрушить секту аурилитов в холодных, ледяных ущельях Тихого Галопа Седрика три года назад. После этого ветер снова подхватил плащ, чтобы унести его туда, где идёт борьба с теми, кто угрожает Равновесию.

Он был капитаном боевого корабля "Скачущая Ронда", 20-пушечного куттера, который считался одним из самых быстроходных кораблей в открытом море. Ни одному из несчастных торговых судов, имевших несчастье встретиться со "Скачущей Рондой", не удавалось уйти от неё - их всегда брали на абордаж, а их товары похищались.

В том, что капитан Аэрил Золотая Борода и его команда успешно грабили торговые суда, не было ничего необычного. Необычным было то, что после того, как пираты со "Скачущей Ронды" захватывали торговое судно, капитал Аэрил изящно спускался по верёвке из "Вороньего гнезда" корабля и элегантно приземлялся на палубу торгового судна. Почти в тот же момент команда захваченного корабля мгновенно влюблялась в капитана пиратов - так сильно, что часто моряки умоляли Аэрила принять их в свою команду. Однако, стоило капитану и его команде покинуть захваченный корабль (вместе с товаром), как моряки торгового судна снова проникались ненавистью к пирату.

Никто не знал, как Аэрилу удаётся очаровывать своих жертв - пока однажды, во время знаменитого спуска по верёвке, красочная повязка капитана не слетела с его почти лысой головы. Как только ноги Аэрила коснулись палубы, все члены его команды, раньше служившие на торговых судах, пришли в себя и немедленно забили капитана до смерти. Довольно быстро было обнаружено, что это повязка капитана пиратов была зачарована таким образом, чтобы делать её обладателя более обаятельным.

К сожалению, повязка упала в море - однако время от времени появлялись слухи об особенно лихом, но очень очаровательном разбойнике, способном выпутаться из любой передряги и обожающем спускаться по канатам. И всегда он носил красочную повязку.

@10467    = ~Milton Sixtoes' Armor +2~
@10468    = ~Milton Sixtoes' Armor started out as very ordinary studded leather armor worn by an even more ordinary thief named Milton Sixtoes (so named since he had six toes on his left foot). Milton belonged to a local thieves guild in the mining city of Mirabar, and thus was tasked with petty thievery of coin purses and the occasional gem.

All was well enough by Milton's ordinary standards, until one day when a thief of notable magical prowess transferred to Milton's guild. The guild master assigned this new thief to be Milton's partner in crime, aiding him in his petty, but profitable dirty deeds. Little did Milton know that his new partner was not satisfied with petty thievery. In fact, it was his partner's higher ambition that almost got Milton in trouble with the local authorities. During thieving assignments with his new partner, Milton began to perform very risky acts of larceny, and not through his own will. It was as if someone else had control of Milton's body and used him to carry out the acts. Luckily for Milton, he was able to perform the higher risk activities, but he knew that one day his luck would run out.

So, one day when Milton was feeling more proactive than usual, he took the day off from thieving and ventured to a Dwarven armorsmith who resided in one of the upper Mirabar mining tunnels. There, with his extra earnings from unwillingly performing his more dangerous thieving, he commissioned the dwarf to upgrade his studded leather and give it the power to ward off other's charms. The dwarf complied and ended up upgrading Milton's ordinary studded leather into fine, extra tough studded leather that made the wearer immune to the spell Charm Person.

Not long after Milton began wearing the armor, he discovered his new partner was the one who cast the spell Charm Person on him and made him take all the extra risks. The last time his partner tried to charm Milton, he (Milton) played along as if he were charmed, snuck up behind his partner, and slit his throat with an ordinary, poisoned dagger. From then on, Milton was very pleased to go back to ordinary, petty thievery, though no more partners were ever assigned to Milton Sixtoes.

@10470    = ~Milton Sixtoes' Armor of Absolute Self started out as very ordinary studded leather armor worn by an even more ordinary thief named Milton Sixtoes (so named since he had six toes on his left foot). Milton belonged to a local thieves guild in the mining city of Mirabar, and thus was tasked with petty thievery of coin purses and the occasional gem.

All was well enough by Milton's ordinary standards, until one day when a thief of notable magical prowess transferred to Milton's guild. The guild master assigned this new thief to be Milton's partner in crime, aiding him in his petty, but profitable dirty deeds. Little did Milton know that his new partner was not satisfied with petty thievery. In fact, it was his partner's higher ambition that almost got Milton in trouble with the local authorities. During thieving assignments with his new partner, Milton began to perform very risky acts of larceny, and not through his own will. It was as if someone else had control of Milton's body and used him to carry out the acts. Luckily for Milton, he was able to perform the higher risk activities, but he knew that one day his luck would run out.

So, one day when Milton was feeling more proactive than usual, he took the day off from thieving and ventured to a Dwarven armorsmith who resided in one of the upper Mirabar mining tunnels. There, with his extra earnings from unwillingly performing his more dangerous thieving, he commissioned the dwarf to upgrade his studded leather and give it the power to ward off other's charms. The dwarf complied and ended up upgrading Milton's ordinary studded leather into fine, extra tough studded leather that made the wearer immune to just about every spell that affected the mind.

Not long after Milton began wearing the armor, he discovered his new partner was the one who cast the spell Charm Person on him and made him take all the extra risks. The last time his partner tried to charm Milton, he (Milton) played along as if he were charmed, snuck up behind his partner, and slit his throat with an ordinary, poisoned dagger. From then on, Milton was very pleased to go back to ordinary, petty thievery, though no more partners were ever assigned to Milton Sixtoes.

Using this armor, wood elf scouts could infiltrate even the most well protected campsites without fear of being discovered by any magical means.

After days of torturing their prisoner, the drow were able to learn how the scouts were able to infiltrate their camps and even the location of the village at which these special armors were being made. Needless to say, every man, woman and child in that village was ruthlessly slaughtered...except one.

Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep. After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic. He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit's creation. Following his master's instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail. He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours. When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate. Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years. His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

According to the debate, the mercenaries were not seen as effective combatants, and certainly not worth the gold they were paid for their meager weapon skills.

In order to pay for their passage back south, the Silver Band was forced to sell several suits of their armor in order to transport their mounts and siege engines, and the Band swore they would never return to the North, even if the region perished under an avalanche of goblins and other freakish monsters. Apparently, their ability to predict the future was not listed in their company annals.

At first he fought his fellow kidnap victims in the pits. However, over time, his fellow abductees died from their wounds and poor treatment, thus leaving Drakkas alone to eventually fight monsters of the Drow's choosing. Drakkas persevered, fueled by his ever-growing hatred for his captors, the hopes of one day escaping and then taking revenge on his kidnappers.

One day Drakkas got his wish - he was able to escape by stealing his jail cell keys from his lazy night guard, and then stealthfully slipping out into the unforgiving Underdark. He managed to steal a couple of scimitars on his way out, which he put to good use while circumventing the twisted corridors of the Underdark. When he emerged on the surface, he immediately sought out his Moon Elf kin. 

Unfortunately, when he found his kin, they ostracized him due to his horrendous battle scars. Embittered and outcast, he made it his mission in life to exact the most painful revenge possible on his kidnappers. Drakkas diligently trained in the dark magics, and continued his formidable weapons training as well. When he got to the point where he felt he was ready, he began to sell his services as a mercenary to earn coin and buy better equipment. One thing in particular he eventually wanted was lightweight chain mail that would not interfere with his spell casting. Luck was with him the day he found a Dwarven armorsmith who could accommodate Drakkas' needs. It was not long after until the armor was finished and Drakkas was ready for his mission of revenge. 

Drakkas disappeared from the people who knew him and utilized his mercenary services, and ventured into the depths of the Underdark, where he was never heard from again. However, his special armor did somehow make it out of the Underdark. No one knows how, but speculation has it that the return of Drakkas' chain mail to the surface world was a subtle message from the Drow.

@10534    = ~Maya Selvinis was a solitary half-elf ranger who lived on the outskirts of Neverwinter. Feeling different and un-whole due to her breeding, she rarely had any interaction with other people except when she was summoned to aid in a crisis. Although she did not care for the company of others, she was more than eager to aid those in peril. However, after helping others, she would quickly return to her solitary ways, despite the general tolerance exhibited by the locals in Neverwinter.

One special event that called for her ranger skills came and changed her life forever. An elderly female cleric of Eilistraee came to Maya and asked her aid in tracking down and destroying a demon that was tormenting her flock. Maya eagerly accepted the quest, put on her splint mail armor, secured her sword, and followed the cleric through the woods. After a day's travel, the cleric stopped at a small clearing between four towering trees. In the middle of the clearing was a small pond of water no wider than a yard. The cleric turned to Maya and said that the demon could be seen in the pond. Doubting, Maya approached the pond and peered in. The only thing Maya saw was her own reflection, and she stated that fact rather tersely to the cleric. The cleric smirked a bit and replied by saying that the demon was her reflection. In fact, the cleric pointed out that the demon was responsible for Maya's solitude and self-pity, and that the only one who was concerned about Maya's mixed breeding was Maya.

Maya scoffed at the cleric, told her that she did not know what she was talking about, turned and started to head back in the direction they came. The cleric shouted back, which startled Maya, and declared that she understood more than Maya could ever know. It was at that point that the elderly cleric revealed herself to be Maya's mother. Maya again scoffed, stating that her mother died long ago. The cleric bowed her head and replied that yes, she did die, but that she was granted the grace of Eilistaee to seek out Maya and aid her - aid her in destroying the demon of self-pity and solitude. The cleric then went on to say that Maya would never find sanctuary by alienating herself from the company of others, but that sanctuary comes from within. Once Maya could accept who she was, what she was, and the fact that there were many out in the world like her and who were willing to embrace her, then sanctuary would follow her, always. Then, in a brief flash of light, the cleric was gone, leaving Maya to stew with the wisdom of the old cleric - her mother.

Maya thought on what her mother said, and soon tried to implement her mother's wisdom. After a few months, Maya found her inner sanctuary, and became more powerful because of it. In fact, that power was also absorbed by her splint mail armor. All those who donned Maya's splint mail felt a peace flow through their being. People found their own personal sanctuary within that armor, which soon became known as Sanctity.

@10535    = ~Sanctity of Being~
@10536    = ~Maya Selvinis was a solitary half-elf ranger who lived on the outskirts of Neverwinter. Feeling different and un-whole due to her breeding, she rarely had any interaction with other people except when she was summoned to aid in a crisis. Although she did not care for the company of others, she was more than eager to aid those in peril. However, after helping others, she would quickly return to her solitary ways, despite the general tolerance exhibited by the locals in Neverwinter.

One special event that called for her ranger skills came and changed her life forever. An elderly female cleric of Eilistraee came to Maya and asked her aid in tracking down and destroying a demon that was tormenting her flock. Maya eagerly accepted the quest, put on her splint mail armor, secured her sword, and followed the cleric through the woods.

Such is the case for this unique armor known as Aasimar's Aura. The armor shimmers with a silvery glow and is adorned with exquisite blue etchings across the breast. One look at the armor and it is simple to see that it possesses powerful protections.

Long ago, the Blood War between the Baazetu and the Tanar'ri spilled over to the material plane. Luckily for most of the world, the battle was far away from any major towns or cities. However, this was still no comfort for the Celestial beings that watched over the material plane. So, it was quickly decided to amass as many Celestial and Aasimar beings as possible and drive the Blood War back into its own abyssal planes. However, because of the great numbers of Tanar'ri and Baatezu, the Celestial beings permanently blessed all the Aasimars' armor with Protection from Evil. This spell allowed the Aasimars to get in close to the evil creatures without getting attacked. Once all the Aasimars were in position, the Celestials gave the order to attack, which completely surprised the hordes of Baazetu and Tanar'ri. The ensuing battle raged for days, with high casualties on both sides, but eventually the evil hordes were pushed back into their abyssal planes.

As a result of the high Aasimar casualties, it was not uncommon for looters to take the armor off the dead. So, from time to time, a set of Aasimar's Aura will pop up in a shop, or on an adventurer who could afford the high purchase price.

It was during one of his foraging expeditions that he surprised a group of dwarven miners of the Brueghor Clan who were new to the region. Before Gohji could raise his hands to show he meant them no harm, an enchanted warhammer shattered his knee, causing him to plummet to the ground. When the dwarves advanced to finish him off, they were brought up short by the giant's tears and they found they could not bear to kill their now-helpless foe. They brought a healer to mend his wounds, and then took Gohji (now dubbed the "Sad Giant") back to his cave. Over the next several weeks, the dwarves brought him food and forged a magical cap for his knee to help him walk again - they called it the "Sad Giant's Cap," and the friendship between the Brueghor Clan and Gohji was mortared in history. 

Gohji and many of the Brueghor Clan were eventually slain during an invasion of gnolls and ogres into the Sunset Mountains, and the Sad Giant's Cap was pried from his bloody body by the gnolls of the Burning Eye Clan.

What is known for certain is that the murderous woman is long gone and her belongings have been found scattered here and there throughout the realms ever since.

Forged of dull black steel, the blade is engraved in the fashion of a barbed tongue while the handle is textured with minute scales. Because the enchanted dagger whips back to the thrower's hand once it has struck a solid object, its barbs can do horrendous damage to a target. Many a bravo were felled by Black Lamia's Tongue before coming within ten paces of her, their last breaths escaping through a burbling, crimson hole in their throats.

"Baron" Sulo would have died that day were it not for a stray ballista round from the Leberm ship - the enormous spear struck the unlucky swordsman squarely and carried him over the side of Sulo's ship in a flash. All that remained of him was his elaborate parrying blade, left spinning on the deck as if he'd never been there.

Sulo elected to graft the swordsman's parrying blade to the stump of his left wrist in the place of a common hook.

He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun.

//@10893    = ~"Cera Sumat," Holy Avenger~
@10894    = ~The holy avenger is the paladin's ultimate weapon against the forces of evil. There are few creatures on the Lower Planes that would not hesitate to confront a holy warrior wielding such a weapon... and this one, perhaps more so than others. Once, it was nothing more than a simple iron sword, but through the courage and faith of one man, it became something more.

The blade of this holy avenger glows with a soft golden light. Inscribed upon the hilt in flowing gold letters is "Cera Sumat," which translates into "Six, now Silenced."  Cera Sumat earned its name through the labors of elderly duke Kholsa Ehld, a man cresting nearly eighty years of age, who vowed to complete a task that the greatest warriors of three kingdoms feared to do... all because of the weeping of a child. 

The times in which Old Duke Ehld lived were ones of great upheaval, and the servitors of Bane were strong, crushing all that stood in their way. Entire kingdoms feared their wrath, and to speak out against them meant death, so many remained silent and turned their eyes from the evils of Bane and his servants. 

During these dark times, the most terrible of Bane's minions were six who called themselves the Lost Followers. Their souls were storms of avarice and hate, and mighty were the powers at their command. They reveled in strife and tyranny... and for all the blood they shed, it was never enough. 

Together, the Lost Followers brought about the downfall of the Silver Court, slaying its king upon his throne and renaming his once-beautiful nation the Barbed Kingdom. After animating his decapitated corpse and having it march through the streets slaying anyone it could find, they brought a rain of fire down upon the city and the lands around, leaving it a barren wasteland. It is said that they dined in the capital's great hall that night as the land burned, and they raised their wine glasses as the screams of the dying reached their peak. 

There was only one survivor. In their last act of malice, the Lost Followers left the king's only daughter, barely five years old, alive to reign as "Queen" over the burned kingdom. They called her the Weeping Queen and cast wards about her so that she might never leave the empty capital, and then left her to starve. Their appetite momentarily slaked, the Lost Followers parted ways and went upon their separate roads of damnation, sowing strife in the Bane's Name.

Old Duke Ehld was the first one to cross the wards of the Barbed Kingdom and seek out the Weeping Queen upon her father's throne. When he found the small girl, he approached, kneeled before her, and told her he had come to pledge his life in her service. In stiff, formal words, he said he had brought food and water and apologized for his lateness, but his bones were old and it had taken him some time to reach this place. The near-starving child stared at him as he pledged his worn blade and his honor to seeing that the ones who had done this terrible crime answered for their actions, if his Queen wished it. After a long, stunned silence, the Weeping Queen found the words to thank him.

From the moment Ehld left the throne room in search of the Lost Followers, the weeping of the queen ended, and she never wept again. 

Over six years, Ehld traveled the lands of Faerun and across the planes themselves, seeking the Six, and asking them to answer for their crimes. Each scoffed at the old man and his worn-looking blade, only to find him a dangerous opponent... and in the end, the victor. He recorded the events of their death upon a stone set into the pommel of his blade, and there was even regret in his writings that he had not been able to enlighten the Lost Followers to turn from their path before it came to its end.

When the last of the Six had answered for their crimes upon the edge of the Cera Sumat blade, Ehld returned to the Weeping Queen and laid the blade at her feet. Where once it had been a tarnished blade, it shone as brightly as the sun, and the stone in the pommel was covered with the writing of his journeys. He detached the stone, and set into a chain, and he gave it to the Weeping Queen. Ehld told her to keep the chain to wear as a reminder of the many evils of the world and that they are never far from one's heart... but if one's heart is true and one's path is righteous, one may triumph against any number of evils.

Duke Ehld outlived his queen, living to the age of 107, at which point Ehld took his Cera Sumat and left the Barbed Kingdom... and is said to have traveled north. In time, the Barbed Kingdom rose to its former glory and its name was changed, and with it, the fate of Cera Sumat and the Medallion of the Lost Followers was forgotten... until your arrival in Kuldahar and the medallion and the Holy Avenger were united once again to meet the Lost Followers in battle one final time. 

But the story of Ehld and Cera Sumat was a story of another time, and of the adventures of another hero. This is now your time, and your epic. If your band counts a paladin among its number, then this ancient blade is yours to wield against the forces of evil... 

And perhaps, if your heart is true, save a land from destruction once again.

Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

There, alone in the cavernous chamber, were Wroth, Hateful, and Furious - the dread sword, axe, and armor of Hurom, ancient ancestor of Alemis, once known as the Bloody Juggernaut before he broke his cursed iron's spell and took the Peacemaker name."

"Alemis, a mere boy, donned the fell armor and took Wroth and Hateful in hand. Alone he cut his way through Borab's motley horde of humanoid raiders until he faced the towering half-giant himself, hacking him down and scattering his army to the wind. His family - father, mother, brothers and sisters alike - had all died by then, but Alemis no longer cared. He stalked the realms, eyes ablaze with madness, slaying monsters and brigands wherever he found them. But as the years passed and Alemis found no more of such wheat to thresh, he took to turning his thirsting blades on all who crossed his path... and so, once more, the Bloody Juggernaut had returned."

  -- from "Master Pelib's Bedtime Tales"

This heavy, unadorned bastard sword of dull gray steel is a cursed thing, only showing its true form when the wielder is wounded in battle. It is then that the hilt sprouts crimson tendrils that bury themselves in the wielder's forearm; drinking his or her blood, the demon-sword opens the three glaring eyes along its twisting, dripping blade and drives the wielder mad with lust for bloodshed.

Should a warrior carry Wroth along with its brothers Hateful and Furious, his or her soul would be lost to the hell-forged arms and armor. To wield even Wroth alone might be construed as insanity... but there will always be those for whom it may be just the weapon they're looking for.

@11020    = ~The saga of Wandering Sky is a tale of hearth and home told by many skalds of the North. The tale exemplifies the persistence and strength of the barbarian spirit.

When the legions of Arakon the Arch-Mage swept across Icewind Dale, the Tribe of the Bear was among the first of the tribes to meet his assault. Overwhelmed by the superior forces, the barbarians fought bravely, but they were no match for Arakon's forces. One of the tribe's eldest hunters and warriors, Hreidgar, was knocked unconscious during the battle, and he awoke to the sky tearing at his face and the remains of his fellows around him. Of his wife and children, there was no trace, and without a word, Hreidgar took up his great sword and followed the path of Arakon's army, determined to reclaim them and avenge the fallen. 

Hreidgar was among the first to pledge his blade to the barbarian shaman Jerrod when he united the tribes against Arakon, and he served tirelessly in the great battles ahead, even on the darkest day when Arakon unleashed armies of the hells against Jerrod and the tribes. In every battle, Hreidgar and his greatsword were as one, howling like the wind as he drove his enemies back... and to their deaths. But when Arakon was at last defeated, no trace of Hreidgar's wife and child were to be found. 

Hreidgar continued his search, and his journey of many years is said to have taken him across the great cliffs of the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears, upon the Sea of Moving Ice where he sailed with the Tribe of the Great Whale and fought slavers from the south, and then to his final destination, the small town of Enholm's Point, where he stood with the handful of the town's defenders against the army of Kresselack the Black Wolf. It is said Hreidgar fought so fiercely that Kresselack conceded the field in honor of the warrior - but not before striking the fatal blow that would end the warrior's life.

Bleeding from numerous wounds, Hreidgar is said to have wandered north from Enholm's Point, traveling for many miles before collapsing to his knees. With the last of his strength, the old warrior plunged his blade into the ice and said he had finally found what he had been seeking. "Let the sky wander," he proclaimed, "for my travels are done."  

When the townsfolk of Enholm's Point returned the next day to carry his body away, they found Hreidgar, but his blade had vanished. It is said that the blade now wanders as the sky wanders, finding its way to others with long journeys before them... and guiding them to their final destination, whatever it may be.

Little is known about the origins of this sword, but Mulhorandi aristocrats have passed its rumor from generation to generation. According to legend, whenever a human Mulhorandi woman gave birth to a girl after having been forced into slavery, she would, on the night of the first full moon, pray to the ancient pharaoh Tyrish for guidance. Hearing her prayers, Tyrish would send "floating down from the heavens" this weapon, originally no larger than a stiletto, and the woman would use it to severely disfigure her child. Once the deed was done, the weapon would enlarge slightly before floating away as gracefully as it had arrived. These "marked" children, now deemed undesirable by their male overseers, would be allowed to purchase their freedom, thus sparing them the horrors of slavery. The scars inflicted upon these children - those physical in nature at least - would eventually heal over time.

For Mordigan, a secret practitioner of the necromantic arts, saw ample opportunity in which to ply his trade. Interring the remains of the evil men within close proximity of the tree, Mordigan called upon the dark powers of the negative material to perform a baleful act upon the black willow. It was given a sort of semi-sentience, and the ability to feed upon the remains of those who had so recently swung from its branches. Black roots descended into rotting flesh; and alarmingly enough, the tortured visages of the slain began to appear in the twisted knots of the black willow's bole before its burning. But, to the surprise of the villagers, the potently ensorcelled staff carved by the hands of the evil Mordigan did indeed prove to be their undoing.

@11092    = ~Ryomaru was one of the greatest spies and assassins of the Kumo clan of Kozakura in Kara-Tur, and his Harmless Staff is anything but. Most of its hollowed length consists of a series of compartments holding poisonous powders, spring-loaded darts, weighted chains, jutting spikes, entangling hooks, and various other concealed weapons. When used in combat there is always a chance that one or more of the staff's nasty little "tricks" will be sprung upon an unwary opponent. However, great care must be taken in its use - the weapon can easily harm the casual wielder.

Ryomaru himself carried the staff on only three missions, eventually leaving it in the care of the Hojori Temple - a Kumo clan front - and moving on to even more cunning and dangerous weapons. When the renowned thief "Chicken" Wu Wei - so named for the falcon tattoo on his chest - burglarized the temple, the Kumo were quick to uncover his involvement and track him back to his homeland in Shou Lung. Wu Wei was forced to flee across the sea to escape their wrath, prompting the dispatch of three more bands of Kumo assassins: one to cross the Eastern Ocean to find Wu Wei, a second to slay the original group that had failed to catch him in Shou Lung, and a third to torture and then execute Wu Wei's every living relative.

"Chicken" Wu Wei retired comfortably on the coast of the Western Heartlands, running a small tobacco shop and only occasionally thinking of his father in Shou Lung, a gambling drunkard who'd beaten Wu Wei's mother and only sister to death when he was a child. When the Kumo assassins at last caught up with Wu Wei, there was naught but a tombstone - the Daring Chicken had sold every last bit of stolen Kumo treasure and died a happy old man.

@11174    = ~This odd pole-arm appears to be a cross between a halberd and a warhammer, fitted with a four-pronged hammerhead and a long thrusting spike.

Its creation was the result of a blunder made during the commission of an enchanted item for Lodur the Brave (alternately known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard), a powerful but none-to-bright cleric. Lodur had of heard rumors of a mighty long-hafted hammer, possibly wielded by a hero known as Lucerne, or perhaps that's where it was made, which may or may not have had to do with a land or king or deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or "something of that nature, I am most certain."

"Oh," he had then added, "and pray thee bless it as well... thou dost know, that one where it explodes undead and what-not, so that I might smite things most explosively."

Lodur's fierce demeanor, violent reputation, and sacks of gold begged quiet compliance, and so the dwarven arms-master simply nodded and sent the cleric on his way, promising the weapon in two months' time. The arm-master consulted with his clan's lore-master and sure enough, there *was* word of such a weapon: it came from a trader in Sigil by way of an exceptionally well-traveled plane-walker. The arms-master dutifully copied the weapon's function and form, working runes of power into its haft and head just as Lodur had asked for.

When Lodur the Brave returned to the dwarven stronghold to pick up his new hammer, he found instead a spiked pole-arm whose use was forbidden by his religion. The cleric ranted and gnashed his teeth and swore up and down the halls of the clan before stomping off in disgust, leaving his payment and the somewhat inappropriately named "Lucerne Hammer" behind.

As fast as he could throw the axe it would return, leaving smoldering corpses wherever it traveled. By any rights this should have been a tale of legend, but with any legend there has to be survivors to tell the tale. Unfortunately, Clan Ironsmelt died that day along with that unnamed dwarf.

@11273    = ~Dullcobble's Axe +4~
@11274    = ~There is little doubt that Dullcobble Tweed was the worst carpenter in the history of the profession, and an even worse weaponsmith, but his continual boasts of his great skill and insight eventually caused his fellows to challenge him to make a throwing axe worthy of his boastful claims. Dullcobble, realizing he had to back his proud words, agreed heartily... but inside, he was struck with fear that he would fail the test.

Dullcobble made several attempts to fashion a chopping axe, most of them ending up as cordwood next to his fireplace. In the day before his challenge was to be called due, his only surviving weapon was a lop-sided axe whose haft was widely overbalanced. Realizing that displaying such a weapon would make him the laughing stock of the community, Dullcobble hired a wild mage to take his misshapen axe and turn it into a serviceable weapon. The mage shrugged, took his payment, and promised the axe to Dullcobble on the dawn of the next day. When Dullcobble woke up in the morning, the misshapen axe lay on his doorstep, unchanged, and he had no choice but to take the axe to his challengers... and take his chances. 

When Dullcobble brought it into the town's meeting hall, the axe's appearance was greeted with derision and laughter. Dullcobble, his face burning, became so angry he threw it at his tormenters - and watched as the haft traveled over the blade's head to smash into a pillar and shatter it, causing the roof to collapse. Dullcobble, slack-jawed with surprise, was knocked unconscious by a falling timber, but the other challengers made it outside without injury.

Dullcobble's blow to the head was a serious one, and it turned him into the village idiot - not much of a change from his previous lifestyle. The axe itself was tossed upon a merchant cart headed north, and it was never seen again. Whatever the enchantments the wild mage scrawled on the axe did, it causes the haft to be the first to strike an opponent, doing crushing damage instead of slashing damage.

@11331    = ~Big Death +1~
@11332    = ~The gargantuan throwing axe known as Big Death is an orcish weapon through and through. Carried to the final battle of the Hand of Seldarine by the hulking orc warlord Yellow-Toothed Grubrun Foul-Tusks, Big Death had its origins in an ogre mercenary's two-handed battle-axe. After a particular vicious raid on a dwarven mining settlement, Grubrun spied the axe lodged in the skull of a dead dwarven marshal. It seems that an ogre mercenary had impaled himself upon the marshal's spear in a careless charge, but his last act had been to nearly cleave his killer's head in twain and, in trying to wrench the axe free for a second blow, shattering the haft before expiring in a bloody heap.

Prying the huge, black cold-iron blade from the base of the dwarf's skull, Grubrun returned to his fortress at Nab-Nurog and had his shaman set to enchanting it. Not having considered fixing the shaft and finding it too heavy and awkward to use in melee, Grubrun deigned to use the weapon as a throwing axe and demanded that it be ensorcelled to return to his hands after being hurled. The warlord found great delight in heaving the enormous weapon about, roaring with glee as Big Death came careening back to him, gleaming and gore-spattered, after lopping some poor enemy in two at the waist.

Grubrun Foul-Tusks finally met his end at the final battle of the Hand where he threw Big Death at the elven weapon master Kaylessa; she deftly sidestepped the flying weapon, darted forward, and ran her own blade through the empty-handed orc's belly. Kaylessa was said to have then coolly ducked as Grubrun's own axe came whirling back at him and cleanly severed his head, rotten yellow tusks and all.

Big Death is an especially large axe - almost ridiculously so - and is only identifiable as a throwing weapon because its short haft and the manner in which it's weighted. In fact, the axe is so massive that it cannot be thrown with a single hand, requiring the wielder to grip it with both hands and hurl it sidelong with the strength of their entire body.

@11342    = ~In the filthy port town of Luskan, executions are a daily occurrence and a welcome relief from the monotony of town life. This greataxe was the only possession of the town executioner, who was reported to never let the blade leave his side, giving it the name of the "Tale of the Executioner's Wife."  As the years passed, however, the town executioner eventually found a willing mistress in one of the town's brothels who seemed untroubled by his profession, and he paid her numerous visits over the following months. When the town authorities came to arrest the harlot (who was actually an accomplished thief) for thefts within the city walls, they found the city executioner in her bed and the woman nowhere to be found. The executioner was implicated in her escape, and his own axe was used to behead him in the town square. The execution had a record turnout, and many agreed that the "executioner's wife" had had her final say on his adultery.

@11396    = ~Belib the Wary was arguably the best-equipped adventurer the realms had ever known - or would have been, had he ever actually left his home on one. Just one item from his astounding list of enchanted dungeoneering equipment is his Everlasting Torch. A magical lantern fashioned in the shape of an elaborate wooden torch, the item burns with a bright orange flame that cannot be extinguished - whether dunked in water, buried under several feet of rock, or smashed over the head of a soggy marsh-troll, Belib's Everlasting Torch simply will not be put out.

When Belib finally finished the last of his items, he crammed them all into a giant pack - enchanted to hold far more than Belib could normally carry himself, of course - and heaved it onto his shoulders, prepared for the adventure of a lifetime. As Belib crossed the threshold of his dwelling he tripped... and the tiny gnome was instantly crushed beneath his enormous backpack. The bag burst open, its contents scattering across the Waterdeep street where Belib had lived and rapidly vanishing into the hands of various good-for-nothing passersby.

Belib's corpse was eventually taken to a temple and raised by a kind-hearted priestess, but by then the last of Belib's enchanted items... and most of the contents of his home... were long gone. Grateful but understandably upset, Belib fashioned a number of unique magical items for the priestess before returning to his family and homeland, forever vanishing from the surface world.

Scholars argue that this is exactly why the mace was made. To grant the wielder a power over creatures that is not normally given.

Second by her abusive husband the duke, who planted assassins amongst her handmaidens... when Roa visited her dearest brother Remin - a powerful baron - the assassins murdered him as he slept and so his lands passed to the duke. The third and final betrayal was at the hands of her sister Rana, who longed to take the duke, his riches, and eventually the royal crown for her own. Rana entwined herself in a plot with Duke Sorim to slay the king, discredit the true heir as his bastard child with Roa, and thereby steal the throne.

Roa, still less than sixteen summers old, was bound with a ball and chain and cast into the duke's infamous dungeons to await the completion of her husband and sister's terrible scheme. She sobbed and moaned day and night, her voice echoing through the keep's halls. The duke soon grew incensed at her constant wailing and sent one of his Ducal Guard to beat little Roa into silence. When the man arrived at the cell, he struck her across the face, shoved her to the ground and made to kick at her belly - but quick as that, Roa sprung up and strangled the man with her chains.

Moments later the willowy young girl burst into the duke's court and attacked him savagely. His guards pelted her with bolts from their crossbows, but onwards she charged. When she reached the Ducal Throne she tossed Sorim's champion aside like a broken doll, swinging the iron ball of her shackles with such strength that it stove in the shocked duke's thrice-enchanted breastplate of meteoric iron, driving shards of shattered ribs into his lungs and heart and killing him instantly.

No one is clear as to how the tale ends - some say that Roa then expired on the spot, her chest and back bristling with bolts, while others describe how her sister Rana leapt up and killed her with a dagger... a few optimistic souls even claim that Roa lived and spent the rest of her days in peaceful bliss. Whatever the case, her shackles remain as a testament to her story.

The chains of Roa's shackles have been looped and wound together in such a way that one can wield them as a flail. Crudely etched into the soft iron of the ball are the words "In Righteousness Lies My Strength."

The chains of Roa's shackles have been looped and wound together in such a way that one can wield them as a flail. Crudely etched into the soft iron of the ball are the words "In Righteousness Lies My Strength."

This weapon is all that remains of Slow Cedric's Gallop, a small frontier settlement located in the Southern Pass of the Spine of the World Mountains. The settlement is believed to have been overrun by a tribe of orcs in the great winter of 1170 DR, and when the cold season passed, the settlement and the bodies of the townsfolk had been buried beneath great mountains of snow. When the first travelers braved the Pass in the spring season, they found only the top of the settlement's great stone belltower peeking through the mountainous drifts. This odd-looking flail was found lying upon the tower's bloodied stone floor, surrounded by the frost-dusted bodies of several dead orcs. 

According to tales, the Black Chimes were a symbol of office of the settlement's Bell Warden, whose duty was two-fold - to ring the warning bell when an enemy was sighted in the pass, and after the warning bell had been rung, to defend the pass with his life. It is believed the first Bell Warden of Slow Cedric's Gallop was the original creator of the Black Chimes, an enchanted flail that would ring to warn the town of danger at the same time as he leapt into battle against his foes.

@11584    = ~This hammer was created by an ingenious gnomish inventor and wizard named Airon Broune. Actually no one really knows if Airon is a gnome or not because no one has actually seen him. Apparently overnight he had taken over an abandoned shop at the edge of small town. One day the shop was vacant and then the next it was boarded up tight with signs in every language telling passersby to go away. Infuriated, the previous owner demanded he leave, but quickly relinquished his claim to the shop when a large sack of gold appeared at his feet. The very next day, mysterious notes began to appear all over town. They all contained the same message and read as follows:

**************************************

Bring potatoes. Will pay in gold.

-Airon Broun

**************************************

Intrigued, a few townspeople decided to take him up on his offer and delivered sacks of potatoes to the shop. They would shove the potatoes into a delivery chute located in the back of the shop and then soon after a small sack of gold would appear, usually five times the going rate of the potatoes. The better the quality of the potatoes the more gold would appear. News soon spread of this wonderful offer and it was not long until every potato in town was sold to the curious gnome. No matter how many potatoes one delivered, there always appeared a sack of gold for payment. 

Needless to say, every farm for miles around started growing potatoes. Each farmer would try to outdo the other by producing the biggest and tastiest potatoes. This continued on for years until finally, the quality of potatoes was so good that instead of gold appearing, magic items of all sorts would appear. Not realizing the magical nature of the items given, the farmers sold them to passing merchants in disgust and stopped farming potatoes altogether. This hammer is one such item. By inserting special enchanted plates into the head of the hammer, the user is able to modify the abilities of the hammer.

On the few occasions that the Tyrannar Brutai Mar has used his weapon on his foes, Brutai has felt increased strength and improved accuracy. In addition, some of the crushing blows were accompanied by bursts of Xvimian acid - the same acid that flows throw the waters within Severed Hand.

@11724    = ~The famed halfling hunter Herrian Smallhill was well known for his ability to fell large numbers of rabbits in a single day. Though Herrian repeatedly was challenged to displays of "real" hunting skill, he always returned to his home near Corm Orp to provide rabbits for his community. A noble elven hunter named Shidan Imraith challenged the halfling to a hunting contest in 1197 DR. When Herrian emerged at the victor, the proud elf became so enraged that he ordered his men to kill the halfling. Though Imraith's house was disgraced for the action and Shidan was brought to justice, Herrian's fine yew bow disappeared.

@11763    = ~Sophia's Flight +2~
@11764    = ~This longbow is the subject of legend among the squabbling citadels of the Sword Coast, a legend fiercely debated in drinking halls and taverns in and along the storm-lashed coast. According to the tale, the bow takes its name from its pivotal role in the escape of a young woman named Sophia, a typical maiden fair who was pledged to marry the son of Duke Hugh Gladegrin (the son is described as hideously ugly and of foul temperament, of course). Sophia, however, believed she was destined to marry one of the Duke's archers, a dashing young golden-haired fellow who roamed the surrounding lands felling foul beasts with a single twang of his mighty bow. As the tale goes, one of the court wizards (a transmuter) took pity on the young woman's plight and cast a spell that turned her into an arrow for an hour's time. The transmuter arranged for Sophia to be fired from the castle wall to a ship waiting off the coast, where she could sail to freedom.

The tale then breaks down from here, as numerous accounts claim that Sophia did not flee the coast safely, and that she transformed back into her normal body while she was halfway across the water, plunging into the icy ocean. Another school claims that, while in arrow form, Sophia pierced the side of the ship, then choked to death when she resumed her normal form with her neck embedded in the ship's hull. Still others claim that she was never even launched from the bow, and that she resumed her normal form while inside the archer's quiver, and she awoke, naked, wearing only the small band of leather about her body. When this last argument is made, the discussion generally deteriorates into a steady stream of sexual innuendos and the evening officially goes downhill.

Whatever the tale, the bow has a range unmatched by many other bows in the realms, and the arrows launched from it strike far and true - unlike the story surrounding the bow.

@11793    = ~Arc of Gold~
@11794    = ~It can be argued that the Arc of Gold and its sister, the Mithral Arc, brought about the end of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North many years past, and led to the destruction of the Severed Hand and the fall of Dorn's Deep. Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. 

At the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North, a disagreement arose between the two races over the matter of trading enchanted weapons to the men of the south, who were beginning to establish a foothold in the North. The dwarves were of the opinion that the many great works that had been built through the joint efforts of the dwarves and elves should be offered up to man and the profits used to fill the coffers of both races. This suggestion was not well-received by the elves nor by their leader, the arch-mage Larrel, and the matter was quickly dropped. 

However, when the Arc of Gold, one of the items fashioned jointly by dwarven and elven weaponsmiths was found in the hands of an orcish war party not long after the debate in the alliance councils, the elves accused the dwarves of selling the weapons to the goblinoids out of greed. The dwarves, insulted, broke the shafts of their hammers in the middle of the council and broke talks with the elves, returning to their halls in Dorn's Deep and never speaking to them again. The two races, now divided, were soon swallowed by the Dark Horde that was devouring the North beneath its banner. 

At the time of the fall of the Severed Hand, the Arc of Gold was mounted within the halls of Severed Hand as a reminder of the dwarven treachery and dwarven greed. When the Severed Hand fell, the Arc of Gold silently watched as the goblinoids tore apart the elvish defenders and laid waste to tower after tower, until the elvish archmage Larrel, in a desperate measure, brought about the Mythal cataclysm that sealed the fate of the Severed Hand once and for all. 

When the Mythal was cast, the Arc of Gold vanished from the halls of the Severed Hand and has not been seen since... until now.

Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. 

The Mithral Arc was developed at the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance, and it was one of the many joint items developed by the dwarves and elves of the Severed Hand before the destruction of the Severed Hand and the Fall of Dorn's Deep. Its accuracy was unparalleled, and the dwarves presented it to the elves as a token of goodwill between the races. The string of the bow was said to have been blessed by the elvish archmage Larrel himself, with a range that seemed to rival the horizon. It was mounted in the halls of Severed Hand so that all visitors could see it, and see the achievements the dwarves and elves united could bring about.

When its brother, the Arc of Gold, was discovered in the hands of a band of orcs raiding in the forests north of Severed Hand, the elves became furious and accused the dwarves of selling the relics the two races had jointly crafted to their enemies. The dwarves, enraged by the insult, seized the Mithral Arc and returned to Dorn's Deep, cutting off all contact with the elves. 

It is said that at the moment the alliance disbanded, the string of the Mithral Arc broke with a final twang, and the bow, useless, remained deep within Lower Dorn's Deep, silently watching as the dwarves were slowly driven deeper and deeper into the Deep by the encroaching goblinoid hordes that had begun to swarm down from the North. It was never seen and never taken by the Dark Horde that marched through Dorn's Deep, and the Mithral Arc remained there for countless years in the darkness with the dwarven dead piled around it, still clutching their weapons. 

How it came to be here is unknown, but the string of the Mithral Arc is restored and the bow is eager to be used. Perhaps there is hope for the fallen elves and dwarves still... or at least the opportunity to reclaim their once-proud homeland from the half-breed hordes that threaten it.

@11924    = ~To the northeast of the great tree-town of Kuldahar lies the Vale of Shadows, a valley of crypts and tombs where Kresselack the Black Wolf is said to be buried. Almost thirty years past, a band of adventurers entered the Vale of Shadows and returned with many relics and treasures taken from the tombs there. Rol-Sayid's Left Hand of Darkness is one such item, though its true purpose was not realized when it was discovered. Considered nothing more than the cast-off bandage of a mummy, it had been used to wrap a gold necklace lying in one of the sarcophagi in the tombs. 

The necklace's wrapping was discarded as soon as the band of adventurers returned to Kuldahar, and as they cast it away, the adventurers joked that it could serve some little boy as a sling if need be. One of the children of Kuldahar was quick to pick up on this comment, and he kept the sling both for hunting and as a good luck charm for several years. It is not known if he knew if the wrapping was magical or not, and he attributed the accuracy of the stones cast from it as his own natural ability rather than that of the sling. 

In truth, Rol-Sayid's Left Hand of Darkness is one of the wrappings from the left hand of one of Kresselack's lieutenants, who had been resurrected as a mummy within the tomb of his lord and served as a guardian against trespassers. When a stone is placed within the wrapping and spun with great force, the stone will fly straight and true at an enemy. Furthermore, as long as the wrapping is held in the hand, the wielder is immune to diseases, both magical and mundane.

//@12155    = ~Viol of the Hollow Men~
@12156    = ~This instrument is also known as "Tallow's Violin," but that moniker is rarely spoken among musicians, as mentioning the name of Nikolai Tallow is considered bad luck. Nikolai was born in The Vast, near High Haspur, the son of a chandler. Because of the intermittent traffic through the region, Nikolai was introduced to many different cultures. One of the travelers he met was an elven musician named Relev Thinriver. Relev introduced Nikolai to the violin and taught him for several years as he wandered through the area. Relev knew that Nikolai was an incredibly gifted child, with quick fingers, a keen mind, and a passion for all things in the world. Relev also recognized that Nikolai was exceedingly proud and arrogant. In spite of Nikolai's shortcomings, Relev taught him everything he knew.

After Relev was killed by a band of orcs, Nikolai began to practice on his own throughout the Vast. Despite his travels, he always returned to the isolate peaks of his mountain birthplace. He became famed throughout the Vast, the southern Moonsea and Sembia for his incredible talent and passionate performances. Eventually, news of the proud young virtuoso spread to the ears of a nearby thug from Calaunt named Tremble Ghon. When Tremble and his gang traveled through the Elvenblood Pass, they stopped at the Elf in Armor Inn and demanded a performance from Nikolai, who happened to be present and eating dinner with his father at the time.

Nikolai refused to perform for Tremble and his men. He called them stinking oafs and attempted to leave with dignity. Tremble assaulted Nikolai's pride by claiming that Nikolai was afraid of performing because he'd be heckled out of the inn for his incompetence. Nikolai shot back that his skill with the violin was so great that he could raise the dead from their graves. Satisfied with a proposed challenge, Tremble immediately grabbed Nikolai's father and stabbed him in the heart. When a number of other villagers attempted to intervene, they were also killed by the bandits.

Tremble defiantly stood over Nikolai's dead father and said, "Where's your big mouth now, fiddle player?"  Without a word, Nikolai pulled his violin and bow out from underneath his arms and began to play a melody that none of the residents of High Haspur had ever heard before, and no one in Faerun would ever hear again. Nikolai played with unbridled passion and fervor. Onlookers later remarked that he appeared to be a madman, thrashing about in ways that people didn't think were possible. At the climax of his frenzied piece, Tremble and his gang watched in horror as the souls of the men and women they had just killed rose from their corpses and dove, shrieking, at their murderers. The bandits died horrible deaths, chilled by the shadows of their victims. Nikolai himself continued playing, dancing through the streets and back pastures of his alpine home until every man, woman, child, and beast ever buried in the region rose from its resting place and milled about until Nikolai and his music disappeared into a far off valley, shrouded in a mysterious fog that vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Legends say that on misty nights, the ghost of Nikolai Tallow returns to his homeland, playing a phantom violin with a host of dancing dead trailing behind him in the moonlight.

After the residents fled, Craum squatted his old bones down upon the blackened buildings, grumbling to himself and snorting flames from his nostrils. 

A few hours and several miles away, the residents of Hornhollow finally decided that someone must go negotiate with the dragon and see what it wanted. When no volunteers were forthcoming, a lottery was conducted - and the loser, a traveling ministrel, Aznee Fraystrings, was given the dangerous task of attempting to deal with the dragon. Aznee had lived out his welcome in the camp many nights previous, and the loggers considered it no great loss if Aznee gained a new home in the dragon's belly.

Aznee, somewhat absent-minded but of a brave heart, stumbled his way into the camp, and finally mustered the courage to speak with the dragon. During the (now-famous) exchange that followed, Aznee discovered that Craum, who was somewhat far along in dragon years and in none too good health, was suffering the draconic equivalent of a bad cough, and his hacking and wheezing masked his plaintive attempts to try and find someone, anyone, who could help cure his fits of coughing. 

Seeing a solution, Aznee offered a cure that helped an elderly uncle of his - a sprig of Maiden's Milk flower, that when crushed and administered in a tea, helped quell coughing in a matter of minutes. Some could undoubtably be found in the forest nearby, Aznee exclaimed, and he set about gathering up several sprigs and preparing them for the dragon. After lumping them into a great pot, he administered the steaming cauldron to the dragon.

It is suspected that either Craug drank the mixture too fast, or else Aznee had mistaken Bellows Root for Maiden's Milk, but whatever the reason, Craug vomited the mixture back out a few seconds later, setting fire to several acres of the wood and torching poor Aznee where he stood. After this vomitus belch, Craug ran wild for almost an hour, trying to spit out the remainder of the concoction. At the end of his rampage, the venerable red dragon fell over dead, the sudden flurry of activity more than his old bones could stand. 

When the loggers came to break down the dragon a day later, they discovered that Craum's bones still carried echoes of his coughing fits, and his entire skeleton creaked and wheezed, even after death. They struck a deal with a local mage, who bought the dragon's bones and fashioned a series of musical instruments with them, dubbed the "Pipes of the Wheezing Dragon."  These yellow bone pipes are famous throughout the Realms and, when used by a bard, they can be used to spit bursts of flames at opponents. Unfortunately, even when not in use, the pipes tend to creak and wheeze, attracting the attention of anyone nearby and making attempts at stealth and pick pocketing useless. 

A thin cord made of dragon gut is strung through the pipes, so they can be worn around the neck and can be easily played when danger threatens. The cord looks charred, as if it was burned recently, and is surprisingly tough.

@12202    = ~The Heart of Winter is often confused with the legendary Heartstone Gem, a powerful scrying artifact that serves as the heart of the great tree community of Kuldahar. The Heart of Winter is not an object, but an expression frequently used by the Uthgart tribes of the north to refer to a warrior or creature that has rid itself of all except one driving focus - usually revenge or hatred. The expression is often used to describe the barbarian lord, Wylfdene, who returned to lead the barbarian tribes in a campaign against the Ten-Towns in the Year of the Cold Soul (1281 Dale Reckoning). According to legend, Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of the shaman Jerrod, one of the barbarians greatest heroes and the one who sacrificed himself in the final battle against the archmage Arakon many hundreds of years ago. Claiming that his body had become home to Jerrod's spirit, Wylfdene rallied the tribes of the North to war to retake the lands that he claimed had been seized by the southerners of the Ten-Towns. Establishing a great war camp in Bremen's Run, a narrow canyon under the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, he fought several quick battles against the dwarves and townsfolk of the region until a small band of adventurers arrived in the town of Lonelywood to try to carve out a peace between the Ten-Towns and the barbarians. Their efforts at diplomacy are said to have failed, but they succeeded in defeating Wylfdene and saving the Ten-Towns from destruction. It is believed that these adventurers are the only reason the Ten-Towns exist (and thrive) to this day.

What happened to these brave adventurers is unknown. The last known record of them is a sighting of them at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, where they spoke with a halfling traveler who claimed to know of a place where great riches could be found. Shortly after this, the adventurers and the halfling vanished and were never heard from again. 

After reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell. When a passage is recited from the book, it allows the reader to inflict the curse of the Heart of Winter upon foes, blinding them with its power or even freezing them where they stand.

Meeting in the Winter's Cradle Tavern, this band of southerners had traveled north in search of adventure, and they were the first to join Hrothgar's expedition to investigate the rumor of troubles brewing in the great tree town of Kuldahar to the North, where a mighty oak, towering hundreds of feet high, sheltered a small town beneath its boughs with a life-giving warmth.

The misfortunes plaguing Icewind Dale led to the ambush of Hrothgar's expedition in the windswept Kuldahar Pass... and it left them the only survivors. Pressing on against goblinoid raiders that filled the Pass, the small band finally reached Kuldahar, only to discover the great tree was being threatened by an unknown evil deep within the mountains - if this evil was not stopped, Kuldahar would be destroyed, and the North itself might soon share the town's fate. 

The brave band of adventurers searched out this evil, their travels carrying them from the crypts of the Vale of Shadows through the numerous ruins of the North, including the decaying elven fortress of the Severed Hand and the lava-filled caverns of Dragon's Eye. Much of their journey has been lost, but there is no doubt that their efforts led to the salvation of Kuldahar and the Ten-Towns and their deeds are still spoken of in Easthaven and Kuldahar to this day. Hrothgar himself has been laid to rest in a small glen near the town of Kuldahar, in memory of his selflessness in coming to the aid of his neighbor in a time when Easthaven itself was suffering troubles of its own. 

Among their other acts of heroism, the adventurers are credited with the discovery of the location of the tomb of Kresselack the Black Wolf, one of the most infamous of the Northern generals, the discovery of the Severed Hand, and numerous other monasteries and ruins believed lost to time and the snows of the North.

After reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell. When a passage is recited from the book, it summons the howling winds of Icewind Dale to the reader's aid.

@12222    = ~Mensel of Cormyr, at one time the Lord of Immersea, was that rare sort of nobleman, a fellow well known to be kind, generous, and humanitarian to a fault. He was much loved by his family, servants, and those that lived upon his lands. Well after the elderly Lord Mensel had passed away in his sleep, a secret vault was found hidden beneath his study. Within the vault Mensel's heirs found a small hoard of treasure... and the Obscene Grimoire.

Though the origins of the grimoire and the identity of anyone associated with it - save the late Lord Mensel, of course - are still unknown, unwholesome rumors sprang up like mushrooms and still abound after nearly a century. The worst of the scandalous claims involved a seer from Arabel, a pious young man that seemed saddened to explain that Lord Mensel had the grimoire fashioned for himself at great expense and then slew all those involved in its making - an assertion that did no less than bring ruin to Mensel's name and family.

The unsavory book was cast into a temple brazier but, to the astonishment of numerous witnesses, it vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling vapor rather than bursting into flames. Since that day the Obscene Grimoire has appeared in many places, never found intentionally and always disappearing again within a few year's time.

The thick, black, leather-bound book is filled with painstakingly detailed woodblock prints, each depicting a gruesome scene of violent perversion. Even the briefest of glances through its disturbing pages is enough to assure the reader that no taboo is left unturned. However, for those willing to carefully peruse the disquieting work, there are dark runes and ritual directions hidden amongst the illumination around each print. Those so inclined are able to use the power of Mensel's Obscene Grimoire to summon a cacofiend, bound to the reader's service, once per day.

Apparently Prashnak was having a great deal of difficulty fending off a relentless scourge of trolls, who no doubt were interested in nothing more than his dug out, well stationed bower. Prashnak used storms of acid to keep the trolls at bay. However the young mage was tiring of the constant attacks, and the trolls were becoming bolder.

After several months of studying the various effects of wilting magic, elemental summoning, and magical methods of frosting, Prashnak was finally ready to try his experiment. After summoning a water elemental, Prashnak evaporated choice bodily components and then froze the hapless creature. This lead to the creation of truly horrific sculptures of ice. The trolls, as simple as they are, took extreme offense to these totems and reportedly fled the area. The experiment a gleaming success, the exultant Prashnak continues his woeful studies to this day. What manner of thief took hold of the bracers is unknown, but they have been missing for several years.

The Cradle of Mielikki was originally blessed by a triumvirate of druids for a ranger named Kell Pathwalker. Kell led a peaceful life, fending off the occasional orc or goblin who might wander into his lands. When he died of old age, the druids had no one to pass the blade on to. The oldest of them, Bimon, held onto the scimitar, but never used it in battle. When Bimon and his associates left their grove for an extended period of time, a wandering mercenary robbed the hollow tree of its riches. He carried the scimitar north to the Spine of the World, where he died of exposure.
