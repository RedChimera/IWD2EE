@56004=~This slider controls the difficulty level to be used in combat. From left to right, the settings are as follows:

* Very Easy: Enemies have a -4 penalty to attack and saving throws, and the party takes half damage.

* Easy: Enemies have a -2 penalty to attack and saving throws, and the party takes three quarter damage.

* Normal: This setting has no changes; Icewind Dale 2: Enhanced Edition was balanced for this difficulty.

* Hard: Enemies have a +3 attack bonus and deal 50% more damage to the party.

* Insane: Enemies have a +9 attack bonus and deal double damage to the party.

In addition, there is an even higher difficulty, Heart of Fury. This difficulty setting can be accessed by opening Config.exe, selecting the "Heart of Fury Mode" option, and starting a new game.

* Heart of Fury: Enemies have triple their base HP plus another 80 HP, +10 to all ability scores, +12 levels in each of their classes, +9 attack, +5 saving throws, deal double damage to the party, and have +10 challenge rating. Many magical items throughout the game are replaced with more powerful versions.

Icewind Dale 2: Enhanced Edition has certain optional components which reduce the bonuses given to Heart of Fury enemies. The bonuses above are assuming no such components are installed.~
