@100  = ~IWD2EE was not uninstalled properly; the files from the previous installation are still in the override folder.
Installing IWD2EE again without removing those files would corrupt various files.
To install IWD2EE, do these steps in this order:
1. Uninstall all your other mods.
2. After you do that, look in the folder called "override" and delete everything from that folder.
3. Install your mods again, including IWD2EE.~
