@539    = ~RANGER:

The ranger is a warrior and a woodsman. He is skilled with weapons and is knowledgeable in the ways of the forest. The ranger often protects and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk. A ranger needs to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life.

NOTE: Wisdom is the casting statistic for a ranger. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-10

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.
* Rangers may select a Favored Enemy at first level. They gain +1 to attack and +4 to damage against creatures of that race type. Rangers gain an additional Favored Enemy every five levels, and the attack bonus against previous Favored Enemies increases by 1.
* Rangers can fight with two weapons as if they had the feats Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting if they are wearing light or no armor only.
* 2nd level: Spellcasting. Rangers gain the ability to cast spells.
* 6th level: The ranger can take the Whirlwind Attack feat provided they meet the Dexterity requirement, ignoring all other requirements.
* 6th level: Set Natural Snare. This ability sets a trap that, which triggered by an enemy, ensnares all enemies within 20 feet for 5 rounds on a failed Reflex save. The save DC is 6 plus the ranger's Wilderness Lore skill. The ranger gains an additional use of Set Natural Snare every 6 levels after 6.
* 7th level: Woodland Stride. The ranger becomes immune to Entangle, Web, and Spike Growth.
* 9th level: The ranger can take the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot feats, even if they don't meet the prerequisites.
* 15th level: The ranger can take the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot feats a second time, which no other class can do.

Disadvantages:
* Rangers gain feats at a slower rate than fighters.
* Rangers do not start with proficiency in heavy armor.~

This spell is especially useful when a mage is surrounded by enemies, and it will not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Like most spells created by drow, Malavon's Rage was designed to bypass spell resistance, as drow often fight enemies that resist magic... such as other drow.~

This spell blinds drow and gray dwarves if a Fortitude save is failed. This spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.~

@523    = ~WIZARD:

The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. However, the most common sort studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His broad range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring.

Note: To cast a spell, a wizard must have an Intelligence equal to or greater than the spells level plus 10. Intelligence is the casting statistic for a wizard.  It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-4

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons except for simple missile weapons.
* Receives a bonus feat every five levels in addition to the normal feats given to all character classes every three levels.
* If the character does not specialize in a school of magic, they gain a +1 bonus to the DC of all their spells.
* Learns two new spells each time they level up, and can also learn spells from scrolls.

Disadvantages:
* Starts with no proficiencies in armor and is a very poor at melee combat.~
@527    = ~BARD:

The bard's strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Hit Points per Level: 1-6

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. The bard is also proficient with large swords.
* Gains one point in Armored Arcana, reducing arcane spell failure by 35%.
* +1 to Alchemy, Knowledge (Arcana) and Spellcraft.
* 2nd level: Spellcasting. Bards gain the ability to cast arcane spells.
* 7th level: The bard may replace one of their known spells with another spell of the same level. They may do this once again every 3 levels after level 7. The bard can only replace spells at least two spell levels below the highest spell level they can cast (e.g. only a 1st-level spell when the bard reaches 7th level), though they can replace 7th-level spells starting at level 25, and 8th-level spells starting at level 28.
* Many rogue like skills are class skills of the Bard.
* Bard Songs. Bards have the ability to sing melodies that have magical effects on creatures within thirty feet. As they advance in level, they gain additional songs. The songs are described in detail below.
* 1st level: The Tale of Curran Strongheart. When played, all the bard's allies gain +1 attack bonus, +1 damage, and immunity to fear and hopelessness. The attack and damage bonuses increase by 1 at levels 10, 25 and 40.
* 3th level: The Song of Kaudies. When played, the bard's allies are immune to harmful sound-based spells and abilities, including Command, Silence, Greater Command, Holy Word, Blasphemy, Power Word: Sleep, Sound Burst, Shout, Power Word: Silence, Power Word: Stun, Power Word: Blind, Great Shout, Wail of the Banshee, Power Word: Kill, harpy wails, and the enemy-only effects of Chant, Prayer, and Recitation.
* 5th level: Tymora's Melody. When played, Tymora's Melody gives the bard's allies +1 luck, +1 saving throws, and +2 to their Knowledge(arcana), Alchemy, and rogue skills. At levels 15 and 35, this song grants an additional +1 to luck and saving throws and +2 to skill checks.
* 9th level: The Siren's Yearning. When played, every creature that hears the song suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to their Will saves for 10 rounds and must make a Will save or be entralled, unable to take action for one round or until they take damage. The Will save DC is equal to the bard's level. Thus, a level 15 bard's song has a DC of 15.
* 13th level: The War Chant of Sith. When played, the bard's allies gain a +2 generic armor bonus, physical damage resistance of 3/-, and they regenerate 3 points of damage per round in combat. At levels 28 and 45, this song grants an additional +2 to AC, 3/- physical damage resistance, 3 hit points healed per round.
* 20th level: The Ballad of Three Heroes. When played, the bard's allies gain +5 spell resistance, 5/- resistance to all forms of magical damage, and the effects of the Tale of Curran Strongheart, Tymora's Melody, and the War Chant of Sith. At levels 30 and 50, this song grants an additional +5 spell resistance and 5/- resistance to magical damage.

A bard cannot benefit the party with more than one song at once. But if the party has multiple bards, the effects of each bard's song will stack. Summoned creatures do not benefit from bard songs.

* 30th level: The bard can now do other actions while singing a bard song.

Disadvantages:
* Bards are not as effective in hand-to-hand combat as warriors or priests.
* Bards have slower access to spells than a wizard or priest.~
@569    = ~SORCERER:

Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they even are the spawn of dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than wizards, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way wizards do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to the wizard.

NOTE: A sorcerer does NOT learn spells from scrolls. He chooses new spells with each level. Charisma is the casting statistic for a sorcerer. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-4

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons.
* 6th level: The sorcerer may replace one of their known spells with another spell of the same level. They may do this once again every 2 levels after level 6. The sorcerer can only replace spells at least two spell levels below the highest spell level they can cast (e.g. only a 1st-level spell when the sorcerer reaches 6th level), though they can replace 8th-level spells starting at level 20, and 9th-level spells starting at level 22.

Disadvantages:
* Starts with no proficiencies in armor and is very poor at melee combat.~

Mass Heal wipes away disease and injury from all living allies in the area of effect.

The caster makes ranged touch attacks against each of those creatures; each one that get hit must Save vs. Fortitude or lose all but one hit point.

(Transmutation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 8, Helm 8
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting him several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster has 15/- resistance to fire, cold, and all forms of physical damage, but also +15 vulnerability to electricity. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored completely, such as poison, blindness, deafness, and disease to name a few, and the caster becomes too heavy to knock back with spells like Gust of Wind, Throw or Repulsion. In addition, the caster gains a +8 bonus to strength and constitution and a -8 dexterity penalty. Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward under the weight of his new body, setting his movement rate to half its normal rate, and he receives a -2 penalty to casting speed.~
