@4003 = ~Although Targos is in a vulnerable state, you have managed to slaughter the entire goblin tribe that was attacking it.~
@4004 = ~The main fortress gates are closed and barred. It would require a battering ram or other siege engine to attempt to get them open, though a Knock spell could also bash them down.~
@4005 = ~This door seems very secure. A key will most likely be needed to gain access, unless there is an exceptionally skilled lockpicker in the party.~

@4007 = ~As you approach the archway Sseth's Eye suddenly stares at you and you begin to feel the overwhelming compulsion to walk away from it. You may be able to resist this compulsion with magic that protects against mind-affecting spells, though it would have to be an especially powerful spell.~
