Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. This silent construct can be wielded as a longsword and may strike targets from a short distance away.

The phantom blade deals 1d8+3 damage with a +3 bonus to attack and strikes as a +6 weapon for the purposes of bypassing weapon immunities, and inflicts an additional 1d10 magic damage (or 1d10+10 damage if the target is undead). Due to its etheric nature, it ignores armor and shield bonuses, though it still strikes harder depending on the wielder's Strength. Although the phantom blade appears as a longsword, it uses the small blade proficiency and can be used with Weapon Finesse. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in her hand for the duration or until dispelled.~

Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting him several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster has 15/- resistance to fire, cold, and all forms of physical damage, but also +15 vulnerability to electricity. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored completely, such as poison, blindness, deafness, and disease to name a few. In addition, the caster gains a +8 bonus to strength and constitution and a -8 dexterity penalty.

Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Fortitude half

This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch and a lich's immunities upon the caster.

Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes two to eight duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which ones are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images shift from round to round so that an enemy must first hit every image before being able to hit the wizard.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Reflex half

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage (Reflex half). After the initial damage, the victim must make a Reflex save every round which will reduce the damage for that round by half and also stop any further acid damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round the victim is entitled to a Reflex save to avoid further damage in any remaining rounds. 

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must make a Reflex save or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.

Vitriolic Sphere bypasses spell resistance.~

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, the caster weakens an opponent, reducing its strength and therefore the attacks that rely upon it.

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Reflex half

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage (Reflex half). After the initial damage, the victim must make a Reflex save every round which will reduce the damage for that round by half and also stop any further acid damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round the victim is entitled to a Reflex save to avoid further damage in any remaining rounds. The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must make a Reflex save or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~

Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect selects the enemies closest to the target and holds them. Enemies making their Will saves are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.  A successful Will save negates any effect.~

Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds/level or until depleted
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Spell Trap absorbs incoming hostile spells and grants their spell slots to the caster. While Spell Trap is active, if the caster would be hit by a harmful spell, that spell is nullified, and the caster regains a previously cast spell of a level less than or equal to that of the absorbed spell. Spells regained this way must also be 7th-level or lower, even if the absorbed spell was higher than 7th-level. Spell Trap can absorb a total of 18 spell levels before it ends, though as long as there is at least one spell level remaining, the next spell will be absorbed.
