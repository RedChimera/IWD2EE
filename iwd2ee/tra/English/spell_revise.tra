Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends 4 feet from the caster's hand. The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can damage, though the bonus does not apply to attack bonus. In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, the blade bypasses armor and shield bonuses to AC, though it still gains damage bonuses from Strength, proficiency, and any other damage bonus a melee weapon could gain. It uses the Simple Weapon: Small Blade proficiency.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of damage, and an additional 1d12+4 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible. A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail. Though it is not made of silver, the moonblade has the same effect against lycanthropes as a silver weapon, dealing full damage to them.

If the caster is already wielding a non-conjured moonblade at the time that they cast this spell, instead of conjuring a new moonblade, the spell will give the current moonblade +3 to attack and damage for the duration.

When cast as a ranger spell, this spell creates a moonblade in each hand.~

Range: Caster
Duration: 20 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. This silent construct can be wielded as a longsword and may strike targets from a short distance away.

The phantom blade deals 1d8+3 damage with a +3 bonus to attack and strikes as a +6 weapon for the purposes of bypassing weapon immunities, and inflicts an additional 1d10 magic damage (or 1d10+10 damage if the target is undead). Due to its etheric nature, it ignores armor and shield bonuses, though it still strikes harder depending on the wielder's Strength. Although the phantom blade appears as a longsword, it uses the small blade proficiency and can be used with Weapon Finesse. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in her hand for the duration or until dispelled.~

The spell checks the creature's current hit points, not their maximum, so even the toughest creatures can be affected by this spell if they are wounded. This spell has no effect on deaf creatures.~
@1126    = ~Iron Body~

Level: Sor/Wiz 8, Helm 8
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting him several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster has 15/- resistance to fire, cold, and all forms of physical damage, but also +15 vulnerability to electricity. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored completely, such as poison, blindness, deafness, and disease to name a few, and the caster becomes too heavy to knock back with spells like Gust of Wind, Throw or Repulsion. In addition, the caster gains a +8 bonus to strength and constitution and a -8 dexterity penalty. Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward under the weight of his new body, setting his movement rate to half its normal rate, and he receives a -2 penalty to casting speed.~

The small wedges of magic do 25d4 points of piercing damage to everything caught in their path (Reflex save with +2 DC for half). This spell is especially useful when a mage is surrounded by enemies, and it will not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Like most spells created by drow, Malavon's Rage was designed to bypass spell resistance, as drow often fight enemies that resist magic... such as other drow.~
@1138    = ~Flaying~

Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Fortitude half

This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch. The wizard's hands are imbued with a chilling force of negative energy, allowing the caster to deal 3d10+5 cold damage (plus damage bonuses from Strength, proficiencies, spells, items and other effects) with each hit and paralyze living victims for 10 rounds on a failed Fortitude save.

Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes two to eight duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which ones are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images shift from round to round so that an enemy must first hit every image before being able to hit the wizard.~

Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a corporeal barrier around the target's body by tapping into the target's life force. The armor itself is weightless, and does not hinder movement or spell casting, granting a +3 generic bonus to AC.

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Reflex half

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage (Reflex half). After the initial damage, the victim must make a Reflex save every round which will reduce the damage for that round by half and also stop any further acid damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round the victim is entitled to a Reflex save to avoid further damage in any remaining rounds. 

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must make a Reflex save or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.

Vitriolic Sphere bypasses spell resistance.~

Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Reflex half

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage (Reflex half). After the initial damage, the victim must make a Reflex save every round which will reduce the damage for that round by half and also stop any further acid damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round the victim is entitled to a Reflex save to avoid further damage in any remaining rounds. The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must make a Reflex save or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~

Creatures must make a Reflex save every round in order to move through the entangled area. Entangled creatures can still perform normal actions but cannot move and suffer a -2 penalty to Armor Class and attack rolls, as well as a 50% chance of spell failure. All creatures within the area of effect who make their Reflex save move at half rate.~

Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

The caster calls upon their god to grant them power for a short period. The caster's Strength, Dexterity and Constitution are all raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster. A third level caster would have their abilities raised by 1, while a 12th level caster would have their abilities raised by 4.

Draw Upon Holy Might is especially effective when cast as a paladin spell. Paladins cast this spell at their full caster level plus 6 (so a 9th-level paladin would have their abilities raised by 5).~

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius

This spell holds animals rigidly immobile. Animals with magical powers such as winter wolves do count as animals, as do some of the more animalistic monsters such as remorhazes. The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and 1-4 animals within 20 feet of the target point are affected. Those who succeed on their Will save are unaffected by the spell. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

(Enchantment) 
Level: Clr 4
Range: Sight of Caster

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Will negates

This spell enables the caster to invade the mind of the target creature, allowing the caster to will the creature into whatever actions he so desires.  The target creature will resist the effects if a successful Will save with +2 DC is made.  While a creature is dominated in such a manner, its mind is cloudy and thought is hampered - spellcasting is impossible and attack bonuses are made with a -2 penalty.~

This spell transforms the air in a 20-foot radius into sickening, grayish mists.  The caster and non-living creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud.  Every round of exposure to the disease-ridden air causes the loss of 4 points of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. Creatures within the afflicted area must make a Fortitude save every round to avoid the debilitating effects of the cloud. The effects will last 1 turn.  Cloud of Pestilence can only be cast by evil characters.~

When the caster evokes Flame Strike, a vertical column of fire blasts downward into the area of effect.  All creatures caught in the area of effect take 1d6 damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

(Enchantment)
Level: Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Will negates 

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a Will save to avoid the effect.  If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected.  The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.
If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.  If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.  Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he was charmed.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

This spell turns a creature invisible and makes it undetectable by normal vision or darkvision. The spell remains in effect until the duration has expired, it is magically broken or dispelled, or until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature. Thus the invisible being can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks or casts a spell, he immediately becomes visible (although the invisibility enables him to attack first).~

Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Will negates 

This spell holds 1-4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures immobile for a short duration. The Hold Person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, lizard men, orcs, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect selects the enemies closest to the target and holds them. Enemies making their Will saves are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.  A successful Will save negates any effect.~

Level: Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3, Mask 3

Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes all creatures within 10' of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even darkvision.  Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.  Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until the duration has expired. Thus the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first.~

The target gets to make a Fortitude save every round; if successful, the berserk state is negated, but the damage is still dealt.  This spell does not work against creatures that do not have blood, such as the undead, elementals, and plants. Creatures with at least 15/- fire resistance are immune to the berserk effect.~

Range: Touch
Duration: 30 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature

(Illusion)
Level: Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
Range: Caster
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

A lesser version of Invisibility, this spell causes the caster to become invisible for a short time, or until the caster attacks or casts a spell on another creature.

Vanish is less effective for sneaking past groups of enemies, and better suited for getting out of tight spots in combat. Wizard/rogues can use this spell as an easy way to prepare for another sneak attack.~

@38251     = ~Identify Creature
(Divination)

Area of Effect: 1 creature

Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

@38253     = ~Levitate
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Reflex negates

This spell suspends the target in the air if it fails a Reflex save (Allies are affected with no saving throw necessary). While levitating, the target cannot move unless it can fly, and it gets a -20 attack penalty with melee weapons, but also gets +20 AC against melee weapons. If cast on an ally, that ally can levitate up and down as well. While the character is selected, hold Left Shift to lift them up or hold Right Shift to pull them down. While at ground level, the character can move and loses the bonuses and penalties, but the spell doesn't end immediately.

When cast on an ally, Levitate lasts 4 rounds. When cast on a non-allied creature, it lasts 10 rounds.~
@37254     = ~Arcane Sight~

Level: Sor/Wiz 3
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the target to temporarily grow twice as large in each dimension. The target gains +8 Strength and Constitution; these are size bonuses which stack with other bonuses to these attributes. The target's speed is also increased (since they cover more distance with each stride). However, the target also gets a -4 penalty to Dexterity, AC, and attack rolls due to increased size. The target cannot benefit from invisibility, blur, or mirror image.~
@37256     = ~Darkness~

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

This spell creates magical darkness in the area of effect. Creatures without darkvision must make a Fortitude saving throw with +3 DC or be effectively blinded. Creatures with darkvision aren't blinded, but even they have only a limited ability to see through magical darkness, getting a -4 attack penalty on a failed save. Creatures with superior 120 foot darkvision (e.g. drow, gray dwarves or deep gnomes) only get a -2 attack penalty. Devils and creatures immune to blindness are unaffected.~

Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius

@38353     = ~Throw
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 3
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Reflex half

This spell throws the target into the air with incredible force. The target is knocked back as it is sent hurtling through the air. When it lands or hits the ceiling, it takes bludgeoning damage based on how fast it was moving right before the collision, up to 5d6 plus 1d6 per caster level (max 20d6 total from a level 15 caster). If the target succeeds on a Reflex save, it is thrown with less force and will only take about half damage.~

(Divination)
Level: Brd 3, Drd 4, Sor/Wiz 3
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell can momentarily gain the ability to see into the future, and can see any attack or spell coming. The target gains three abilities, which can be used to give them a +25 bonus to attack, to AC or to saving throws, depending on the ability chosen, for 1 round. Once one of these abilities is used, all three disappear. If not used, the abilities also disappear after 3 hours.

The abilities granted by Moment of Prescience can be used as a free action.~
@37355     = ~Fly~
@38355     = ~Fly
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 3, Rgr 3, Sor/Wiz 3
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This wondrous spell gives the recipient the power to fly. For the duration, the character can fly over normally impassable gaps and obstacles. In addition, unless the character is fighting in melee or casting a touch spell, they will be flying far enough above the ground that most melee attacks against them will be made at a -20 penalty. The effects of Fly are suppressed as long as the character is indoors.~
@37356     = ~Perception Filter~
@38356     = ~Perception Filter
(Illusion)
Level: Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 10 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Perception Filter causes the recipient to attract less notice without actually being invisible. Enemies will ignore the character, not attacking or casting spells on them, as long as there is someone else they can target instead (who isn't affected by this spell). If there are no other allies they can target instead, the enemies will notice the character and attack them.

If a character under the effect of this spell attacks or casts a spell, that does not cause the spell to end, but the enemy they are currently targeting can still notice them.~
@37357     = ~Legend Lore~
@38357     = ~Legend Lore
(Divination) 
Level: Brd 3, Oghma 3
Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3

A more powerful version of the spell Identify, Legend Lore temporarily increases the lore of the caster, allowing them to identify multiple magical items. For the duration, the caster's Knowledge (Arcana) is increased by 30.~
@37358     = ~Project Image~
@38358     = ~Project Image
(Illusion)
Level: Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an illusory duplicate of the caster. For the duration, the caster controls this image instead of their body, can see through its eyes, and can command it to attack or cast spells. Spells cast this way use up the caster's spell slots.

Importantly, any damage the image takes will not harm the caster when the spell is over, and any status ailments inflicted on the image will not affect the caster. Thus, this spell can be used to send the image into risky situations that would be unwise to send the actual character into.

While Project Image is active, the character record screen and HP bar record the stats of the image rather than the caster. When the image takes damage or is killed, the HP bar will go down, but the caster will be fine afterwards as long as their body didn't take damage.

The spell ends early if the image is destroyed (it starts with the same HP as the caster), if it's dispelled, if the caster is killed, or if the party moves to another area.~
@37359     = ~Glibness~
@38359     = ~Glibness

Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius

@38452     = ~Phantasmal Killer
(Illusion)
Level: Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Will or Fortitude negates

Phantasmal Killer causes the target to be struck down by an embodiment of its worst fears. The target may make a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. On a failure, they must make a Fortitude save or die. Even on a successful Fortitude save, they still take 3d6 magic damage. If the target was panicking when they got hit by this spell, the DC of both saves is increased by 6.~
@37453     = ~Ghoulish Feast~
@38453     = ~Ghoulish Feast
(Necromancy)
Level: Clr 4, Sor/Wiz 4
Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell lets the caster summon undead by killing other creatures. During the duration of this spell, whenever the caster kills a creature, a ghoul rises to feast upon the remains. That ghoul will serve the caster for 8 hours. A ghoul will only be summoned if the caster dealt the killing damage to the creature; if the caster damaged the creature but another party member finished it off, the caster will not get a ghoul. The ghouls' paralyzing touch uses the DC of this spell as cast by the caster. Ghoulish Feast cannot be cast by good characters.~
@37454     = ~Copy Spell~
@38454     = ~Copy Spell
(Universal)
Level: Brd 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Permanent until released
Casting Time: Free action
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell copies a spell that another creature is casting, allowing the bard to cast that spell once. Copy Spell should be cast on another creature that is casting a spell. The bard gains a special ability that lets them cast that same spell. Once used, the ability is gone until Copy Spell is cast again. Copy Spell cannot copy innate abilities, nor can it copy spells of a higher spell level than the bard can currently cast. Casting Copy Spell itself is a free action, but casting the copied spell could take some time.~
@37455     = ~Polymorph Self~
@38455     = ~Polymorph Self
(Transmutation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 4
Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds / level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Polymorph Self allows the caster to assume the form of a creature of moderate power. While in another form, the caster has its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, base Armor Class, resistances, immunities, attacks, and special abilities. The caster can polymorph into one of the following forms:

* Fomorian Giant (can throw boulders at long range)
* Troll (regenerates 1 HP per second)
* Umber Hulk (nearby enemies must make Will save each round or be confused)
* Wyvern (can fly, and each hit poisons the target on a failed Fortitude save)~
@37456     = ~Imbue with Spell Ability~
@38456     = ~Imbue with Spell Ability
(Universal)
Level: Clr 4, Brd 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 8 hours or until released
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting Imbue with Spell Ability, the caster grants another creature the ability to cast one of the caster's spells once. Immediately after casting this spell, the caster must attempt to cast another spell of any level, which must be an abjuration, conjuration or divination spell. Instead of being cast, that spell is stored in the creature on which Imbue with Spell Ability was just cast (consuming one use of the spell). That creature gains a special ability that lets them cast the spell once. If unused, that ability disappears after 8 hours.~
@37457     = ~Chaos Cast~
@38457     = ~Chaos Cast
(Universal)
Level: Sor/Wiz 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell casts a random wizard spell on the target creature, which could be a spell of any level between 1 and 8. The nature of the spell depends on the target. If the target is an enemy, they will receive a harmful spell, but if the target is an ally, they will receive a beneficial spell. Targeting restrictions are obeyed (a spell that only affects the caster will not be rolled unless the target is the caster).

The main advantage of Chaos Cast is that the random spell is more likely to be higher than level 4 than lower (since there are more levels above level 4 than below). The disadvantage is that the spell might not be useful in the current situation.~
@37551     = ~Steal Spells~
@38551     = ~Steal Spells
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5, Mask 5
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell steals memorized spells from the target and grants their spell slots to the caster. The caster makes a Pick Pockets roll, adding their caster level (and any normal bonuses to Pick Pockets). For every 10 points of the total roll, the target loses one memorized spell of 5th-level or lower, and the caster regains one spell of 4th-level or lower (prioritizing the highest-level spells that can be lost or regained this way). There is no Saving Throw, though Spell Resistance may prevent the theft.~
@37552     = ~Ghostform~
@38552     = ~Ghostform
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 5, Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 5
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns the recipient incorporeal for a limited period of time. While incorporeal, the character gets damage reduction 5/+1, and they have a 50% chance to ignore any instance of physical damage. They are still tangible enough to attack and cast spells. The recipient can also move through walls while incorporeal. Simply click on a point to move to, and the character will float to that point, bypassing normally impassable obstacles in the way.~
@37553     = ~Rewind Time~
@38553     = ~Rewind Time
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5
Range: Caster
Duration: -2 rounds
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell briefly reverses time for the caster, reverting them to the state they were in two rounds ago. The caster's HP is restored to what it was two rounds ago, as is their location in the area. The caster also regains the magical effects they had two rounds ago, while losing effects gained in the past two rounds (including harmful status effects). Rewind Time does not restore memorized spells expended in the last two rounds.~

Level: Brd 5, Clr 6
Range: Touch
Duration: 8 hours or until triggered

Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature

(Conjuration)
Level: Drd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
Range: Special
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: All creatures in path of boulder
Saving Throw: Reflex partial

Boulder Roll creates a large boulder, which rolls forward from the caster, crushing creatures in its path, until it hits a wall. Creatures hit take 12d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked down for 2 rounds. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents one from being knocked down. The boulder always travels due south from the caster.~
@37654     = ~Songcasting~
@38654     = ~Songcasting
(Universal)
Level: Brd 8
Range: Special
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Songcasting lets the bard store a spell, which has a chance of being cast automatically each round that the bard sings their bard song. Immediately after casting this spell, the bard should attempt to cast another spell of 1st-level. Instead of being cast, this spell will be stored (expending one use of the spell).

Each round for the duration, if the bard is singing a bard song, there is a chance (1% per bard level) that the spell will be cast on each creature the bard song affects. Even spells with a range of Caster can target other creatures this way. The spell can potentially be triggered multiple times over many rounds.~
@37655     = ~Void Sound~
@38655     = ~Void Sound
(Necromancy)

(Universal)
Level: Drd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
Range: Special
Duration: 8 hours or until all charges are expended
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets the caster store a spell in a staff, which casts the spell each time it is used to attack a creature. Immediately after casting this spell, the caster should attempt to cast a 1st-level spell that can target a point or a creature other than the caster (or one that gives the caster a weapon to make a touch attack against a creature). Instead of being cast, this spell will be stored in a Spellstaff, which is wielded by the caster.

The Spellstaff has a number of charges equal to the caster's level. Each time the caster attacks with the staff, a charge is used to cast the stored spell on the target of the attack. The stored spell is always cast with a caster level of 10, regardless of the caster's actual level. The staff has a range equal to the range of the spell, deals no physical damage, and automatically hits (unless the stored spell is one like Shocking Grasp that requires an attack roll, in which case the staff requires an attack roll to hit).~
@37657     = ~Freeze Inanimates~

(Transmutation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 6
Range: Caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

A lesser time manipulation spell, Freeze Inanimates stops time for all inanimate objects that are not being worn or carried by a creature. Any arrow, bolt, bullet, or other projectile that is fired or thrown by a creature during the duration of this spell will freeze in midair immediately, as it is no longer being carried. Magical projectiles are also frozen immediately after being conjured. All creatures can still move and do actions while time is stopped. Items can still be picked up from the ground, as the effects of this spell end for them when they are grasped by a creature. Once the spell ends, any projectile that had been frozen by the spell will resume flying toward its target.~

(Conjuration)
Level: Sor/Wiz 7
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Will partial

Stygian Ice Storm is the signature spell of gelugons. When cast, it summons a storm of hellish ice from Stygia, the fifth layer of the Nine Hells. All creatures in the area of effect take 12d6 cold damage with no save, and must make a Will saving throw or be effectively feebleminded for 3 rounds due to the severe memory loss caused by Stygian ice. The caster is unaffected, as are undead creatures.~

Level: Sor/Wiz 7

This spell envelops the caster in a magical cloak of force, which blocks all but the most powerful physical attacks. For 4 rounds, the caster gains damage reduction 15/+3. The damage reduction increases based on the level of the caster:

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Reflex half

This spell fires a flurry of small lightning bolts at the target. One bolt is fired per level, each one dealing 1d8 electrical damage (Reflex save with +4 DC for half) to all creatures in its path. The bolts will bounce off walls, potentially hitting the same creature multiple times per bolt.~

Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Nearest corpse in 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell "resurrects" the target as an undead creature under the caster's control, retaining the stats and spells it had in life. The nearest dead creature to the target point, excluding undead, constructs, most extraplanar creatures, and creatures more than five levels higher than the caster, will be reanimated. It picks up and re-equips items it dropped when it died, unless the party took those items. Creatures that exploded into chunks cannot be reanimated. Reanimate cannot be cast by good characters.~

(Universal)
Level: Brd 7, Sor/Wiz 7, Oghma 6
Range: Special
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Spell Sequencer lets the caster store three spells to be released later on. After casting Spell Sequencer, the caster must attempt to cast up to three spells of 4th-level or lower. Instead of being cast, those spells are stored in the sequencer (expending one use of each spell). The caster then gains the innate ability "Release Spell Sequencer." Using that ability immediately casts all three spells on the target of the ability.

Spells with a range of "Caster" will be cast on the caster, regardless of the target of the ability. Spells with limited range will fail if the target is outside the spell's range.~

This spell brings forth a magical object that imbues creatures that see it with the desire to be near it.

Any creature immune to charm effects is also immune to this effect.~
@37760     = ~Skip Time~
@38760     = ~Skip Time
(Transmutation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 7
Range: Special
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Party
Saving Throw: None

Skip Time transports the party ten rounds into the future. From the point of view of other creatures, the party vanishes, then reappears in the same spot ten rounds later. However, no time has passed for the party.

The main effect of this is to reduce the duration of all magical effects on creatures outside the party by ten rounds, ending effects like Mantle that have short durations and causing the rest to expire sooner. Lingering areas of effect such as Web and Stinking Cloud also have their duration reduced. Skip Time can also allow the party to evade area of effect spells and abilities when timed right.~
@37761     = ~Forcecage~
@38761     = ~Forcecage
(Abjuration)
Level: Sor/Wiz 7
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-foot cube
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a cage of force - a cube with walls of force on each side. Creatures that were in the area of effect when the spell was cast are trapped in the forcecage for the duration. Creatures cannot enter or pass through the area of effect. Only one forcecage may be active at a time.~
@37762     = ~Skeleton Traps~
@38762     = ~Skeleton Traps
(Necromancy)
Level: Sor/Wiz 7
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Reflex half

This spell animates two skeletons which can be detonated on command to deal damage. When you have a skeleton use its special ability, or the skeleton takes damage, its skull explodes like a Skull Trap, dealing 10d6 slashing damage to all creatures within 15 feet (Reflex save for half), and the skeleton is destroyed. At 24th level, the spell animates three skeletons instead of two. Skeleton Traps cannot be cast by good characters.~
@37763     = ~Spell Turning~
@38763     = ~Spell Turning
(Abjuration)
Level: Brd 7, Sor/Wiz 7
Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds/level or until depleted
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Spell Turning reflects incoming hostile spells back at the source. While Spell Turning is active, if the caster would be hit by a harmful, single-target spell of any level, that spell is reflected back at its own caster. Spell Turning can reflect a total of 15 spell levels before it ends, though as long as there is at least one spell level remaining, the next spell will be reflected. It does not reflect Dispel Magic either, though it cannot be dispelled itself.~
@37764     = ~Steal Effects~
@38764     = ~Steal Effects
(Abjuration)
Level: Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 7, Mask 6
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Will negates

This spell steals the effects of spells from the target and grants them to the caster. If the target fails a Will save with +5 DC, all dispellable effects on them (such as from Mirror Image or Stoneskin) are dispelled, and the caster gains those effects for their remaining durations. Effects of items and innate abilities cannot be stolen. If an ally is targeted, they are affected with no save.~
@37852     = ~Energy Drain~
@38852     = ~Energy Drain
(Necromancy)
Level: Clr 8, Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Similar to the energy drain of a wight or wraith, except much more powerful, this spell drains multiple levels from a creature. The target is drained one level for every three levels of the caster, to a maximum energy drain of 16 levels for a 48th-level caster. The energy drain is permanent until cured with a Restoration spell. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.~
@37853     = ~Enslave~
@38853     = ~Enslave
(Enchantment)
Level: Brd 7, Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Will negates

This spell allows the caster to permanently gain full control of another creature. The target must make a Will saving throw with +4 DC. If it fails, it is dominated by the caster until it dies or the effect is dispelled. Enslave can even affect undead and constructs.~
@37854     = ~Army of Images~
@38854     = ~Army of Images
(Illusion)
Level: Brd 8, Mask 8
Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

Army of Images is like Mirror Image, except as an area of effect. When cast, all allies within 20 feet become surrounded by eight illusory duplicates. Incoming attacks may hit the duplicates rather than the real creatures.~
@37855     = ~Teleport Step~
@38855     = ~Teleport Step
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 8, Sor/Wiz 8, Selune 9
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Among the greatest teleportation spells, Teleport Step lets the recipient teleport anywhere in the area simply by moving. Click on a destination for the character, and they will teleport there. The character can teleport any number of times with this spell.~
@37856     = ~Spell Trap~
@38856     = ~Spell Trap
(Abjuration)
Level: Brd 8, Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds/level or until depleted
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Spell Trap absorbs incoming hostile spells and grants their spell slots to the caster. While Spell Trap is active, if the caster would be hit by a harmful spell, that spell is nullified, and the caster regains a previously cast spell of a level less than or equal to that of the absorbed spell. Spells regained this way must also be 7th-level or lower, even if the absorbed spell was higher than 7th-level. Spell Trap can absorb a total of 18 spell levels before it ends, though as long as there is at least one spell level remaining, the next spell will be absorbed. Spell Trap does not absorb spells cast by allies. It does not absorb Dispel Magic either, though it cannot be dispelled itself.~
@37857     = ~Link Effects~
@38857     = ~Link Effects
(Enchantment)
Level: Brd 7, Clr 8, Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell links the caster and the target such that any spell effect that would be applied to one creature is also applied to the other. Link Effects only duplicates effects from spells and certain abilities of monsters; effects of items and non-magical abilities are ignored.~
@37858     = ~Metafireball~
@38858     = ~Metafireball
(Evocation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Reflex half

Also known as Fireballball, this spell launches a fireball that explodes into other fireballs. After the Metafireball explodes, each creature in the area of effect is hit by a separate fireball with its own area of effect. Each of the secondary fireballs deals 3d6 fire damage (Reflex save with -5 DC for half). This spell is most effective when cast at a large group of creatures clumped together.~
@37859     = ~Otto's Irresistible Spin~
@38859     = ~Otto's Irresistible Spin
(Enchantment)
Level: Brd 7, Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

Otto's Irresistible Spin forces multiple creatures to spin in place against their will for 3 rounds. Affected creatures will do nothing other than repeatedly spin in place, even if they see enemies. The spell is irresistible - there is no Saving Throw, and Spell Resistance will not block the spell. If an affected creature takes damage, the effects of the spell immediately end for that creature. A creature cannot be affected by this spell more than once per 8 hours.~
@37860     = ~Omnipresence~
@38860     = ~Omnipresence
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 7, Cleric 8, Sor/Wiz 7
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 30 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Omnipresence spreads the essence of the target creature throughout the area, allowing the creature to do actions at longer range than normal. For the duration or until dispelled, the creature can attack any creature in sight with any weapon, even with melee weapons. The creature can also target other creatures with touch spells at long range, and can cast spells at a target outside their visual range. However, these effects also go the other way. An omnipresent creature can be attacked with melee weapons and targeted by touch spells at long range. Since Omnipresence makes the creature's form less solid, the creature can move through other creatures while under the effects of the spell.~
@37861     = ~The Jester's Party~
@38861     = ~The Jester's Party
(Conjuration)
Level: Brd 8
Range: Entire area
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Everyone in current area
Saving Throw: None

This spell teleports every creature in the current area next to the caster. Casting this spell in a dungeon could lead to a massive fight, so the caster had better be prepared.~
@37862     = ~Simulacrum~
@38862     = ~Simulacrum
(Illusion)
Level: Brd 8, Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Simulacrum creates a duplicate of the caster, which will serve the caster for the duration. It has half the caster's hit points and half the caster's level (rounded up) in each of the caster's classes. The simulacrum retains the memorized spells of the caster, which it can cast as well (but only those of a low enough level). It has no equipment, so it is useful primarily as an extra spellcaster. A character can only have one simulacrum at a time.~
@37863     = ~Reverse Gravity~
@38863     = ~Reverse Gravity
(Transmutation)
Level: Drd 8, Sor/Wiz 8, Selune 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a large spherical area that reverses the gravity of creatures inside it. Any creature that enters the area of effect will start falling up. While in the air, the creature cannot move unless it can fly. Creatures that hit the ceiling (if indoors) could potentially take bludgeoning damage depending on how fast they were rising. Only one sphere of reversed gravity may be active at a time.~
@37864     = ~Polar Ray~
@38864     = ~Polar Ray
(Evocation)
Level: Drd 8, Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 2-foot by 1000-foot jet
Saving Throw: Reflex half

Upon casting this spell, the caster emits a freezing beam in the direction of the target point. The beam continues past the target point all the way to the end of the area. All creatures in the beam's path take 1d6 cold damage per level (max 25d6), with a Reflex save for half. The beam deals this damage again half a round later.~
@37865     = ~True Polymorph~
@38865     = ~True Polymorph
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 7, Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Unlike lesser polymorph spells, True Polymorph can turn a creature into an inanimate object. If the target fails a Fortitude saving throw with +4 DC, it is transformed into a keg. While in keg form, the target cannot do anything, but their equipment can still be found inside the keg when it is split open. The effect lasts until dispelled.

If True Polymorph is cast on a petrified creature, it will instead duplicate the effects of Stone to Flesh.~
@37952     = ~Perfect Invisibility~
@38952     = ~Perfect Invisibility
(Illusion)
Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the ultimate form of invisibility. While under the effect of Perfect Invisibility, a creature can attack, cast a spell or otherwise interact with another creature or object while remaining completely invisible. However, Perfect Invisibility can still be dispelled by effects that would dispel regular invisibility, such as True Seeing or Dispel Magic. Barring such removal, the spell will last for 2 rounds.~
@37953     = ~Improved Alacrity~
@38953     = ~Improved Alacrity
(Transmutation)
Level: Clr 9, Drd 9, Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Caster 
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell eliminates the interval between spellcasting, allowing the caster to begin a new spell as soon as he or she finishes casting the previous one. A spellcaster under the effects of Improved Alacrity can cast multiple spells in the space of a single round, but the concentration involved prevents the caster from benefitting from decreased casting time effects (such as Improved Initiative) for the duration of the spell.~
@37954     = ~Living Lightning~
@38954     = ~Living Lightning
(Evocation)
Level: Drd 8, Sor/Wiz 8, Talos 8
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: Random creatures within 20 feet
Saving Throw: Reflex half

Living Lightning is essentially a spell that repeatedly casts itself. When cast, a lightning bolt shoots out of the caster, targeting a random enemy within 20 feet (if there are no enemies within 20 feet of the caster, nothing happens immediately). The bolt deals 10d8 damage, with a Reflex save at +4 DC for half. Every round thereafter for the duration of the spell, another lightning bolt is released, requiring no further action by the caster.~
@37955     = ~Malavon's Corrosive Fog~
@38955     = ~Malavon's Corrosive Fog
(Conjuration)
Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 20 rounds
Casting Time: 12
Area of Effect: 40-foot radius
Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Malavon's Corrosive Fog is another spell created by the dark elf sorcerer Malavon. It creates an enormous cloud of acid fog that lingers for a long time. Each round, any creature in the fog takes 12d6 acid damage (Fortitude save for half), and their movement rate is halved (there is no save against the movement penalty). The target's Spell Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@37956     = ~Lightning Spiral~
@38956     = ~Lightning Spiral
(Evocation)
Level: Drd 9, Sor/Wiz 9, Talos 9
Range: Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Reflex half

This spell envelops the caster in a spiral of lightning, releasing lightning bolts in all directions. Eight bolts are released per level (four at a time), each dealing 1d8 electrical damage (Reflex save with +4 DC for half). Lightning Spiral does significantly more damage to creatures close to the caster.~
@37957     = ~Mass Omnivision~
@38957     = ~Mass Omnivision
(Divination)
Level: Brd 8, Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Special
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell increases the visual range of all creatures to the maximum, such that they can see anything in the area that isn't blocked by a wall. Creatures can also cast spells and fire ranged weapons at creatures from much farther away than normal.~
@37958     = ~Improved Haste~
@38958     = ~Improved Haste
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 8, Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell drastically speeds up the target's movement and attack speed. For the duration, the target gains +8 AC, moves at quadruple speed, and attacks twice as many times per round. Attack bonuses will continue to decrease for attacks beyond the 5th one. This effect does not stack with Haste.~
@37959     = ~Time Stop~
@38959     = ~Time Stop
(Transmutation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Caster
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell stops time for everyone and everything except the caster. All other creatures cannot move or act, while the caster can act for three rounds of apparent time.~
@37960     = ~Mordenkainen's Disjunction~
@38960     = ~Mordenkainen's Disjunction
(Abjuration)
Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Mordenkainen's Disjunction dispels all dispellable effects on the target. There is no saving throw. This spell can even remove the effects of Spell Turning, Spell Trap, Antimagic Field, or a Protection from Magic scroll.~
@37961     = ~Eclectic Sequencer~
@38961     = ~Eclectic Sequencer
(Universal)
Level: Wiz 9
Range: Special
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Eclectic Sequencer may only be cast by generalist wizards. It lets the caster store eight spells to be released later on. After casting Eclectic Sequencer, the caster must attempt to cast up to eight spells of 7th-level or lower, each of which must be of a different school. Instead of being cast, those spells are stored in the sequencer (expending one use of each spell). The caster then gains the innate ability "Release Eclectic Sequencer." Using that ability immediately casts all eight spells on the target of the ability.

Spells with a range of "Caster" will be cast on the caster, regardless of the target of the ability. Spells with limited range will fail if the target is outside the spell's range.~
@37962     = ~Wish~
@38962     = ~Wish
(Universal)
Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Special
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

Wish is among the mightiest spells a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, they can alter reality to better suit them. Even a Wish spell, however, has its limits.

In casting Wish, the caster has two initial choices. The first choice is to duplicate a wizard spell of 8th-level or lower (including one of a specialist wizard's opposing school), which will target the caster. The other choice is to make a more powerful, one-time wish. There are several choices of a one-time wish:

* Permanently raise one of the caster's ability scores by 1 (there is a separate one-time wish for each ability score).
* Create a powerful magic item.
* Create 100000 gold.
* Make it as if the caster has rested 8 hours and re-memorized all their spells.
* Duplicate an epic spell, which will target the caster (there is a separate one-time wish for each spell).

Each one-time wish cannot be chosen more than once by a single character, and a character may make no more than three one-time wishes, no matter how many times they cast Wish.~
@37963     = ~Soul Bind~
@38963     = ~Soul Bind
(Necromancy)
Level: Clr 9, Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This foul spell should be cast on a living creature that is about to die. If the target dies within 3 rounds, its soul is captured in a gem within the caster's inventory. The gem must be of great value - either a star sapphire, a king's tear, or a rogue stone - and cannot already contain a soul. A creature whose soul is captured this way cannot be resurrected.

Any character who knows the spell Soul Bind (or any fiend, regardless of whether they know the spell) can use a gem with a soul as a consumable item. Doing so shatters the gem and consumes the soul utterly, but gives the character a benefit of their choice:

* Permanently raise one of the character's ability scores by 1 (each ability score cannot be increased by more than 2 this way).
* Fully restore the charges of a magic item in the character's inventory (items that give permanent bonuses cannot be recharged).

Undead, constructs, summoned creatures, and creatures with less than 13 HD are unaffected by Soul Bind. This spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity when cast on an enemy. It can only be cast by evil characters.~
