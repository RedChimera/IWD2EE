Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands.  This silent construct can be wielded as a longsword and may strike targets from a short distance away.  

The phantom blade deals 1d8+2 damage with a +2 bonus to attack and strikes as a +5 weapon for the purposes of bypassing weapon immunities, and inflicts an additional 1d10 magic damage (or 1d20 damage if the target is undead).  Due to its etheric nature, it ignores armor and shield bonuses but gains no bonuses or penalties from the wielder's Strength.  This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in her hand for the duration or until dispelled.~
@1118    = ~Ball Lightning~
@1119    = ~Ball Lightning

Through this spell, the caster creates tiny balls of electricity that can be hurled in combat.  Upon a successful ranged touch attack (e.g. an attack that ignores armor bonuses) the ball will burst and deal electricity damage to all creatures in a 5-foot radius.  If the caster fails her attack bonus at +5, the ball will dissipate harmlessly.  Each ball deals 1d3 damage per three caster levels with a Reflex save for half (DC equal to 10 plus the caster's level divided by 3). The caster may throw as many balls as she likes until the spell expires.~

(Divination) 
Level: Sor/Wiz 7, Oghma 6, Tempus 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Similar to Power Word: Silence and Power Word: Kill, Power Word: Stun is another of the words of power. Creatures with less than 50 hit points are stunned for 4-16 rounds, those with 51 to 100 hit points are stunned for 2-8 rounds, those with 101 to 150 hit points are stunned for 1-4 rounds, and those with more than 151 hit points must make a Will save at -2 or be stunned for one round. The spell checks the creature's current hit points, not their maximum, so even the toughest creatures can be affected by this spell if they are wounded. This spell has no effect on deaf creatures.~

Level: Sor/Wiz 8, Helm 8
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting him several powerful resistances and abilities.  While the spell is in effect, the caster has 15/- resistance to fire, acid, electricity, and all forms of physical damage.  Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored completely, such as poison, blindness, deafness, and disease to name a few.  In addition, the caster gains a +8 bonus to strength and constitution and a -8 dexterity penalty.  Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward under the weight of his new body, setting his movement rate to half its normal rate, and he receives a -6 penalty to casting time.~

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped, planar rift, about three feet long.  It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell.  The sword acts as a +10 weapon and deals 2d12 damage per strike as well as draining 1d6 hit points from the victim and granting it to the caster.  Further, the blade drains a single level from the target with each hit on a failed Fortitude save, imposing a -1 penalty to hit and damage and a -5 penalty to HP.  The save DC is equal to the caster's level.~

All living creatures within a 10-foot radius of the victim, with the exception of the caster, suffer extreme nausea and are at a penalty of 2 for attack bonuses, damage, and saving throws.  This penalty can be resisted with a successful Fortitude save every round a creature remains within 10 feet of the victim.  The caster may strike multiple creatures with this attack; the spell is not expended after a single use.~

This horrid spell strips the flesh from a target, causing a magically induced bleeding wound that deals 4 damage per round for the duration of the spell, with an additional 4 bleeding damage for every 10 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 16 damage per round at level 30.

(Necromancy)
Level: Sor/Wiz 6
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Fortitude half

This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch and a lich's immunities upon the caster. The wizard's hands are imbued with a chilling force of negative energy, allowing the caster to deal 2d10 cold damage on a successful touch attack and paralyze living victims for 10 rounds on a failed Fortitude save.  While the spell is active, the caster is treated as undead, becoming immune to poison, disease, bleeding wounds, energy drain, death magic, petrification, stun, emotion spells, cold damage, paralysis, charm, berserk, confusion, fatigue, sleep, and fear. However, the transformation is draining for the caster, who suffers -2 Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution and cannot benefit from any form of healing magic until the duration expires.

(Illusion) 
Level: Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2, Mask 3
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes two to eight duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which ones are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images shift from round to round so that an enemy must first hit every image before being able to hit the wizard.~

Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons a shimmering sword of force that can be mentally wielded by the caster. Despite the fact it is held in the hand, it can hit creatures anywhere within the sight of the caster. The sword has a bonus to attack equal to the caster's level and damages its target for 3d6+3 points of damage.

Also, for each creature that dies in this manner the caster receives a +1 bonus to strength, dexterity, and constitution for 1 turn. Soul Eater has no effect on undead or constructs.~

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range.  When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid.  The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage (Reflex half).  After the initial damage, the victim must make a Reflex save every round which will reduce the damage for that round by half and also stop any further acid damage.  If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round.  For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round.  Each round the victim is entitled to a Reflex save to avoid further damage in any remaining rounds. 

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target.  Any creatures within the splash radius must make a Reflex save or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster.  Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.
