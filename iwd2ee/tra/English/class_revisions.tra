@526    = ~Bard~
@527    = ~BARD:

The bard's strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Hit Points per Level: 1-6

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. The bard is also proficient with large swords.
* Gains one point in Armored Arcana.

* 4th level: Tymora's Melody. When played, Tymora's Melody gives the bard's allies +1 luck, +1 saving throws, and +2 to their Knowledge(arcana), Alchemy, and rogue skills. At level 22, this song grants an additional +1 to luck and saving throws and +2 to skill checks.
* 7th level: The Siren's Yearning. When played, every creature that hears the song suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to their Will saves for 10 rounds and must make a Will save or be entralled, unable to take action for one round or until they take damage. The Will save DC is equal to the bard's level. Thus, a level 15 bard's song has a DC of 15. The song has a 25% chance of affecting the bard's allies.
* 10th level: The Song of Kaudies. When played, the bard's allies are affected by the Blink spell for one round. All enemies have a 50% miss chance against the party, but the party also suffers a 20% miss chance against enemies and a 20% rate of spell failure.
* 13th level: The War Chant of Sith. When played, the bard's allies gain a +2 generic armor bonus, physical damage resistance of 3/-, and they regenerate 3 points of damage per round in combat. At level 25, this song grants an additional +2 to AC, 3/- physical damage resistance, 3 hit points healed per round.
* 16th level: The Ballad of Three Heroes. When played, the bard's allies gain +5 spell resistance, 5/- resistance to all forms of magical damage, and the effects of the Tale of Curran Strongheart, Tymora's Melody, and the War Chant of Sith. At level 28, this song grants an additional +5 spell resistance and 5/- resistance to magical damage.

All songs do not stack unless otherwise specified. Until the bard learns the Ballad of Three Heroes, the songs are mutually exclusive; the party cannot benefit from more than one song at a time. Summoned creatures do not benefit from bard songs.

Disadvantages:
* Bards are not as effective in hand-to-hand combat as warriors or priests.
* Bards have slower access to spells than a wizard or priest.~

The cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the spiritual needs of a community. He is both protector and healer, though he is not totally defensive.

Advantages:

* Clerics receive special powers and spells from their deity.
* Spontaneous Casting: Clerics can convert their spells to cure (if good or neutral) or inflict (if evil) spells of the nearest level when a player shift-clicks on a spell at the time of casting.

* Clerics are weaker in combat than fighters, rangers, paladins, and barbarians.~

The fighter is a champion, swordsman, soldier, and brawler. He lives or dies by his knowledge of weapons and tactics. Fighters can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good fighter needs to be strong and healthy if he hopes to survive.

Hit Points per Level: 1-10

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, bastard swords, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.
* Receives a bonus feat at first level and every two levels after that. This is in addition to the normal feat received by all character classes every three levels.
* Characters with four or more levels of fighter may take the Weapon Specialization feat (three ranks in a weapon). This gives them +5 to damage with that weapon type.
* Fighters get an additional +1 to weapon damage at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30.

Disadvantages:
* Fighters lack any spellcasting ability.~
@534    = ~Monk~
@535    = ~MONK:

Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best-known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow. 

WARNING: A monk who multiclasses to a class other than monk or their order's favored class will never be allowed to advance in the monk class again.

NOTE: Multiclassed monks ONLY use their monk levels when determining their base attack bonus and number of attacks when fighting unarmed.

Hit Points per Level: 1-8

Advantages:
* The monk attacks at a faster rate than other characters while unarmed:

Level 1-3: 2 attacks per round
Level 4-6: 3 attacks
Level 7-9: 4 attacks
Level 10-12: 5 attacks
Level 13-15: 5 attacks, plus a 20% chance after each hit to immediately make another attack
Level 16-20: 5 attacks, plus a 40% chance after each hit to immediately make another attack
Level 21-25: 5 attacks, plus a 70% chance after each hit to immediately make another attack
Level 26-30: 5 attacks, plus a 100% chance after each hit to immediately make another attack

* As the monk increases in levels, the damage his fists inflicts does as well:

Level 1-3: 1d6
Level 4-7: 1d8
Level 8-9: 1d8+1
Level 10-11: 1d8+2
Level 12-15: 1d8+3
Level 16-20: 1d8+4
Level 21-30: 1d8+5

* Ki Strike: At level 8, the monk's unarmed attack is empowered with ki. The unarmed strike damage from such an attack can deal damage to a creature with damage reduction, such as a wight, as if the blow were made with a weapon with an enhancement bonus equal to the monk's damage bonus. Thus, a level 12 monk's fists strike as a +3 weapon.
* A monk's natural armor class starts at 10, and then increases by +1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
* When not wearing armor a monk adds his Wisdom bonus to his AC in the same manner as his Dexterity bonus.
* Stunning Attacks: When this ability is used, all of the monk's attacks in the next round force the victim to make a saving throw or be stunned. A monk can make a stunning attack 1/day/level.
* Evasion: Monks have the ability to evade damage from area affect spells. Whenever a monk makes a successful reflex save against an area effect spell that allows a reflex save for half damage, he or she takes no damage.
* 2nd level: Deflect Arrows. The monk gains the Deflect Arrows feat, yielding a +1 miscellanous bonus against missile weapons.
* 3rd level: Still Mind. The monk gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells and effects from the Enchantment school. Unarmored movement speed increases.
* 5th level: Purity of Body. The monk gains control over his body's immune system. He gains immunity to all diseases.
* 6th level: Unarmored movement speed increases.
* 7th level: Wholeness of Body. The monk can regain hit points equal to their monk level times their Wisdom modifier once each day.
* 9th level: Improved Evasion. The monk gains the Improved Evasion feat that is normally only available to rogues.
* 10th level: Unarmored movement speed increases.
* 10th level: Abundant Step. The monk may teleport to any location in sight once per day.
* 11th level: Diamond Body. The monk is in such control of his own metabolism that he gains immunity to poison of all kinds.
* 12th level: Unarmored movement speed increases.
* 13th level: Diamond Soul. The monk gains spell resistance. His spell resistance equals his level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must roll the monk's spell resistance or higher on 1d20 + the spellcaster's level.
* 15th level: Quivering Palm. This terrifying attack allows the monk to set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can be fatal. The monk can use the quivering palm attack once per day. The next time the monk hits a creature with an unarmed attack, the target dies unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + one-half the monk's level + Wisdom modifier). Constructs and undead cannot be affected. Unarmored movement speed increases. The monk gains additional uses of Quivering Palm at levels 21 and 27.
* 18th level: Unarmored movement speed increases.
* 19th level: Empty Body. The monk can assume an ethereal state for 2 rounds a number of times a day equal to his level divided by 2.
* 20th level: Perfect Self. The monk has tuned his body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that he becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider (extraplanar creature) rather than as a humanoid. For instance, charm person does not affect him. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 20/+1. This means that the monk ignores (instantly regenerates) the first 20 points of damage from any attack unless the damage is dealt by a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus (or better), by a spell, or by a form of energy (fire, cold, etc.). As an outsider, a 20th level monk is subject to spells that repel enchanted creatures, such as protection from law.

Disadvantages:
* Loses many bonuses if wearing armor and/or using weapons.~
@536    = ~Paladin~
@537    = ~PALADIN:

A paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true. Like the fighter, the paladin is a man of combat. However, the paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry. He strives to be a living example of these virtues so that others might learn from him as well as gain by his actions.

NOTE: Wisdom is the casting statistic for a paladin. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

WARNING: A paladin who multiclasses to a class other than paladin or their order's favored class will never be allowed to advance in the paladin class again.

Hit Points per Level: 1-10

* Paladins are immune to all forms of disease.
* 2nd level: Smite Evil. Once per day, the paladin may now attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack.

Paladins can smite evil an additional time every 10 levels.
* 2nd Level: Aura of Courage. Paladins become immune to fear, and allies within 10 feet receive a bonus of +4 to saving throws against fear effects.
* 3rd level: Remove Disease. The paladin gains the ability to remove disease from other characters a number of times per day equal to his level divided by 3.
* 3rd Level: Turn Undead. When this power is invoked, the paladin attempts to use the power of his or her patron deity to terrify a group of undead. The higher the paladin's level and charisma are, the greater his or her chance of success is. Though this ability is similar to the cleric's Turn Undead ability, the paladin's ability functions as though he or she were two levels lower than a cleric.
* 4th Level: Spellcasting. Paladins gain the ability to cast spells.

Disadvantages
* The paladin must be lawful good or neutral good in alignment and must choose a divine order. This choice of an order restricts the paladin's multiclassing possibilities.
* The paladin must react to evil deeds that occur in his or her presence.~
@538    = ~Ranger~

* Rangers can fight with two weapons as if they had the feats Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting if they are wearing light or no armor only.
* 4th level: Spellcasting. Rangers gain the ability to cast spells.
* Every 6 levels, rangers gain a use of the spell Set Natural Snare, which ensnares all targets for 5 rounds on a failed Reflex save. The save DC is 6 plus the ranger's Wilderness Lore skill.

Disadvantages:
* Rangers gain feats at a slower rate than fighters.
* Rangers do not start with proficiency in heavy armor.~
@540    = ~Rogue~
@541    = ~ROGUE:

Hit Points per Level: 1-6

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons, the martial weapon bows, and light armor.
* Rogues receive a larger number of skill points per level than any other character class. They can use these extra skill points to buy class skills like Disable Device to remove traps, Hide, Pick Pockets, and Use Magic Device.
* Sneak Attack: To use Sneak Attack, attack an enemy's back when you have a melee weapon equipped. Your first successful attack at the creature's back will do normal damage plus 1-6 points of damage with an additional 1-6 points at 3rd level and every two levels thereafter.
* 2nd level: Evasion. When a rogue reaches 2nd level, he or she gains the ability to evade damage from area affect spells. Whenever a rogue makes a successful reflex save against an area effect spell that allows a reflex save for half damage, he or she takes no damage.

* 6th level: Uncanny Dodge: Rogues can't be Sneak Attacked by another rogue unless the attacker is four or more levels higher.
* 10th level: Special Abilities: The rogue now gains access to a number of new feats available only to rogues. These include Crippling Strike, Improved Evasion, and Slippery Mind.

@4732     = ~Haunted Ether~
@4733     = ~Both complex engineering and mystical study are necessary to create this bottle of enchanted gas. The alchemist must first invest in a fractional distillation column to collect the necessary gas from the atmosphere. Once the gas is collected, it must be infused with one or more hostile spirits. Reciting blasphemies in a graveyard is sufficient if the alchemist is well-versed in Abyssal or is familiar with the teachings of the most popular deity among the dead; otherwise the alchemist must resort to graverobbing, and conduct various illegal and unpleasant rituals with exhumed corpses.

If the alchemist successfully enrages the local spirits, he or she may bind them to the collected gas. Delivering repeated electrical charges to the imprisoned spirits will gradually disorient them, allowing the bottle to be thrown just like a grenade.

@4740     = ~Purified Ichor~
@4741     = ~Ichor can come from many sources, but the most convenient source is the bloodstream of a Bhaalspawn. In its unaltered state, the blood is little different from any other--extracting its true power is a complex process.

First, the Alchemist must conduct research into the parent deity and design a ritual to activate the hidden potential of the ichor. From there, the essence must be filtered out by leeching the blood with mummy wrappings, distillation, and precipitation in a centrifuge, producing a sweet-smelling golden liquid... or, in the case of ichor from evil deities, a foul mixture of grease and coarse dust.

Consuming the resulting substance is usually fatal; the purified ichor must be diluted and adapted to the user's system to have any positive effect. The exact method depends on the user, and requires intensive research and testing to discover. If the user is lucky, the method might be as harmless as crushing up some pearls and mixing the ichor with pumpkin juice and butter to produce an odd-flavored but perfectly drinkable potion.

If the user is unlucky, administering the dose might require vivisection.

Regardless of the method, the final result is a violent twisting of the digestive tract and the spread of the ichor through the user's body. The process is immensely painful and draining, permanently lowering the user's Constitution by 1 and dealing 10d10 poison damage with a save vs. death at -4 for half damage. If the user survives the process, he or she gains +1 to Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as the divine ichor suffuses their system.

If the user dies in the process, he or she may try again after being resurrected, but once the attempt is successful, further doses will have no affected on the imbued character.

The user must open the bottle and inhale deeply, holding the gas in their lungs until the plasma is absorbed into the bloodstream.

The bottle is lined with residue from slain Will o' Wisps and toxic mushrooms, and the gas imbued with the souls of fallen treants.

The wielder may throw the bottle much like a grenade, bypassing any armor or shield bonuses the target may possess. Any creature unfortunate enough to touch the fumes will suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to spell resistance as the enchantment seeps into their system, rendering them vulnerable to hostile spells.

By heating and cooling the alloy in the presence of magnets and using a magical fire to burn other rare metals in its presence, an alchemist can add a powerful magnetic field to the liquid alloy which only activates when the fluid is drunk. The magnetic field is incredibly dangerous to the drinker, as it pulls weapons directly to the drinker's body, imposing a -5 penalty to hit, damage, and AC as well as a -10 penalty to all forms of physical damage.

However, the drinker can will this magnetic field to produce a violent backlash against his or her attackers that inflicts 10d4 crushing damage with every strike. The field will dissipate after 10 rounds.

This may require destroying multiple magical items depending on their power.

When drunk, the syrup creates an anti-magic field around the user's body, automatically dispelling all dispellable effects (both positive and negative) as well as granting 10/- spell resistance for 10 rounds.

Much of the science is unknown to humanoids, but an Alchemist may concoct a special version of the histachii brew from Yuan-ti lymph and mandrake root that will grant the drinker some limited resistance to poison.

Partly fermented and treated with lime and salt, this potion becomes a bitter fluid indistinguishable from paint. The concoction is extremely toxic when drunk normally, so the would-be drinker must build up a tolerance by taking small sips of the milk over the course of several days. Violent seizures, fits of vomiting, and terrifying hallucinations are typical side effects of the process.

Once the user adjusts to the toxins, however, he or she may use the negative energy in the vampire milk to close their wounds. This bitter potion heals 6d10 hit points with every bottle.

Singing lullabies, burning incense, and paying compliments to the moss are all critical parts of the process.

Nurtured with love and blessed with plenty of exposure to moonlight, this moss will develop a faint glow. If the alchemist has treated it well, the moss will gladly spend its precious energy to bring a dead creature back to life.

Its power spent and its personality sacrificed for the sake of the alchemist's fallen comrade, the moss will lose its glow. The user is well advised to throw the moss away--keeping it around tends to make one somber, and the moss wouldn't want its best friend to be sad.
