Using it makes your next spell affect all creatures within 20 feet of the target, but causes it to take up a spell slot five levels higher.

Mass Spell replaces the spell's normal area of effect, so it should only be used with spells that normally target a single creature.~

Prerequisite: To start taking ranks in this feat, you need two ranks in Spell Focus: Necromancy, 12 levels of wizard or sorcerer or 10 levels of necromancer, and evil alignment. To take the final rank, you need 20 levels of wizard or sorcerer or 18 levels of necromancer.

@522    = ~Wizard~
@523    = ~WIZARD:

The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. However, the most common sort studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His broad range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring.

Note: To cast a spell, a wizard must have an Intelligence equal to or greater than the spells level plus 10. Intelligence is the casting statistic for a wizard.  It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-4

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons except for simple missile weapons.
* Receives a bonus feat every five levels in addition to the normal feats given to all character classes every three levels.

@524    = ~Barbarian~
@525    = ~BARBARIAN:

From the frozen wastes of the north and the hellish jungles of the south come brave, even reckless, warriors. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly throw himself into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent.

Hit points per level: 1-12

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.
* Barbarian Rage: Can rage once per day per every 4 levels (starts at 1st level with one use). Rage gives them +4 to Strength and Constitution (which stack with other bonuses to Strength and Constitution), as well as a -2 AC penalty, +2 to Will saves, and immunity to fear, stun, sleep, charm, domination, confusion, unconsciousness, paralysis, feeblemind, and hopelessness. The rage lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 plus the barbarian's (newly improved) Constitution bonus. After raging the barbarian will be fatigued for three rounds, giving them a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity.
* Fast Movement: Barbarians can move 10 feet faster than a standard character, provided they are not encumbered or wearing heavy armor.
* 2nd level: Damage Reduction. The barbarian gains 1/- point of resistance to slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage. He or she gains 1/- additional point of resistance at levels 5, 8, 11, and every 3 levels thereafter. If the barbarian wears medium armor, the damage reduction granted by this feature is doubled.
* 2nd level: Uncanny Dodge. Barbarians retain their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class if they are attacked by invisible foes.
* 5th level: Improved Uncanny Dodge. Barbarians cannot be Sneak Attacked by rogues unless the attacker is at least four levels higher than the barbarian.

@526    = ~Bard~
@527    = ~BARD:

The bard's strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Hit Points per Level: 1-6

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. The bard is also proficient with large swords.
* Gains one point in Armored Arcana, reducing arcane spell failure by 35%.
* +1 to Alchemy, Knowledge (Arcana) and Spellcraft.
* 2nd level: Spellcasting. Bards gain the ability to cast arcane spells.
* Many rogue like skills are class skills of the Bard.
* Bard Songs. Bards have the ability to sing melodies that have magical effects on creatures within thirty feet. As they advance in level, they gain additional songs. The songs are described in detail below.
* 1st level: The Tale of Curran Strongheart. When played, all the bard's allies gain +1 attack bonus, +1 damage, and immunity to fear and hopelessness. The attack and damage bonuses increase by 1 at levels 10, 25 and 40.
* 3th level: The Song of Kaudies. When played, the bard's allies are immune to harmful sound-based spells and abilities, including Command, Silence, Greater Command, Holy Word, Blasphemy, Power Word: Sleep, Sound Burst, Shout, Power Word: Silence, Power Word: Stun, Power Word: Blind, Great Shout, Wail of the Banshee, Power Word: Kill, harpy wails, and the enemy-only effects of Chant, Prayer, and Recitation.
* 5th level: Tymora's Melody. When played, Tymora's Melody gives the bard's allies +1 luck, +1 saving throws, and +2 to their Knowledge(arcana), Alchemy, and rogue skills. At levels 15 and 35, this song grants an additional +1 to luck and saving throws and +2 to skill checks.
* 7th level: The bard may replace one of their known spells with another spell of the same level. They may do this once again every 3 levels after level 7. The bard can only replace spells at least two spell levels below the highest spell level they can cast (e.g. only a 1st-level spell when the bard reaches 7th level), though they can replace 7th-level spells starting at level 25, and 8th-level spells starting at level 28.
* 9th level: The Siren's Yearning. When played, every creature that hears the song suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to their Will saves for 10 rounds and must make a Will save or be entralled, unable to take action for one round or until they take damage. The Will save DC is equal to the bard's level. Thus, a level 15 bard's song has a DC of 15.
* 13th level: The War Chant of Sith. When played, the bard's allies gain a +2 generic armor bonus, physical damage resistance of 3/-, and they regenerate 3 points of damage per round in combat. At levels 28 and 45, this song grants an additional +2 to AC, 3/- physical damage resistance, 3 hit points healed per round.
* 20th level: The Ballad of Three Heroes. When played, the bard's allies gain +5 spell resistance, 5/- resistance to all forms of magical damage, and the effects of the Tale of Curran Strongheart, Tymora's Melody, and the War Chant of Sith. At levels 30 and 50, this song grants an additional +5 spell resistance and 5/- resistance to magical damage.

A bard cannot benefit the party with more than one song at once. But if the party has multiple bards, the effects of each bard's song will stack. Summoned creatures do not benefit from bard songs.

* 30th level: The bard can now do other actions while singing a bard song.

Disadvantages:
* Bards are not as effective in hand-to-hand combat as warriors or priests.
* Bards have slower access to spells than a wizard or priest.~
@528    = ~Cleric~
@529    = ~CLERIC:

The cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the spiritual needs of a community. He is both protector and healer, though he is not totally defensive.

Hit Points per Level: 1-8

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons as well as hammers, flails, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.
* Clerics can cast powerful defensive and healing spells.
* Clerics have the ability to Turn Undead. When this power is invoked, the cleric channels positive or negative energy, which has various effects on undead. The higher the cleric's level and charisma are, the greater his or her chance of success is. If the cleric is good, or a neutral follower of a non-evil deity, their turning causes undead to flee, or destroys them outright if the turn undead roll is high enough. If the cleric is evil, or a neutral follower of an evil deity, their turning causes hostile undead to cower before them, or takes control of the undead if the turn undead roll is high enough, while allied undead are instead bolstered, making them more difficult for enemy clerics to turn. If an allied undead has been turned by an enemy cleric, an evil cleric can dispel the turning with a turning on their own.
* Clerics receive special powers and spells from their deity.
* Spontaneous Casting: Clerics can convert their spells to cure (if good or neutral) or inflict (if evil) spells of the nearest level when a player shift-clicks on a spell at the time of casting. The spell clicked is immediately removed from the character's memorized list and cast as the nearest cure or inflict spell of the same level.

Spontaneous Casting Spells:
1: Cure Light Wounds/Inflict Light Wounds
2: Cure Moderate Wounds/Inflict Moderate Wounds
3: Cure Serious Wounds/Inflict Serious Wounds
4: Cure Critical Wounds/Inflict Critical Wounds
5: Raise Dead/Slay Living
6: Heal/Harm
7: Resurrection/Destruction
8: Greater Restoration/Energy Drain
9: Mass Heal/Mass Harm

Disadvantages:
* Clerics do not have access to many powerful offensive spells.
* Clerics are weaker in combat than fighters, rangers, paladins, and barbarians.~
@530    = ~Druid~
@531    = ~DRUID:

The druid serves the cause of nature and neutrality; the wilderness is his community. He uses his special powers to protect it and to preserve balance in the world.

* Monk Weapons: The monk can wield quarterstaves, daggers, throwing daggers, and darts with very few penalties (one fewer attack per round than with fists, but the monk will still get an extra attack per round every 3 levels).

* As the monk increases in levels, the damage their fists inflicts does as well:

Level 1-2: 1d6
Level 3-4: 1d8
Level 5-7: 1d8+1
Level 8-10: 1d8+2
Level 11-13: 1d8+3
Level 14-16: 1d8+4
Level 17+: 1d8+5

* Ki Strike: At level 5, the monk's unarmed attack is empowered with ki, and gains +1 enchantment with corresponding bonuses to attack and damage. This enchantment bonus increases by +1 every 3 levels after level 5, up to +5 at level 17.
* A monk's natural armor class starts at 10, and then increases by +1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
* When not wearing armor (robes are acceptable) a monk adds their Wisdom bonus to their AC in the same manner as their Dexterity bonus. If the monk is shapeshifted, they will only gain this benefit if their monk level is greater than or equal to the minimum level required to shapeshift into that form.
* Stunning Attacks: When this ability is used, all of the monk's unarmed attacks in the next round force the victim to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Wisdom modifier + half the monk's level) or be stunned for 1 round. A monk can make a stunning attack 1/day/level.
* Evasion: Monks have the ability to evade damage from area of effect spells. Whenever a monk makes a successful Reflex save against an area effect spell that allows a reflex save for half damage, he or she takes no damage.
* 2nd level: Deflect Arrows. The monk gains the Deflect Arrows feat, yielding a +1 miscellanous bonus against missile weapons. In addition, the monk automatically blocks the first instance of missile damage that would hit them each round. The monk must have a hand free to block missiles this way.
* 3rd level: Fast Movement. The monk moves 10 feet faster than a normal character (normal movement speed is 30 feet), but only as long as the monk is not encumbered or wearing armor. The monk gains another 10 feet of movement every 3 levels thereafter.
* 3rd level: Still Mind. The monk gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells and effects from the Enchantment school.
* 5th level: Purity of Body. The monk gains control over their body's immune system. They gain immunity to all diseases.
* 7th level: Wholeness of Body. The monk can regain hit points equal to their monk level times their Wisdom modifier once each day per seven levels.
* 9th level: Improved Evasion. The monk gains the Improved Evasion feat that is normally only available to rogues.
* 10th level: Abundant Step. The monk may teleport to any location in sight once per day.
* 11th level: Diamond Body. The monk is in such control of their own metabolism that they gain immunity to poison of all kinds.
* 13th level: Diamond Soul. The monk gains spell resistance. Their spell resistance equals their level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must roll the monk's spell resistance or higher on 1d20 + the spellcaster's level.
* 15th level: Quivering Palm. This terrifying attack allows the monk to set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can be fatal. The next time the monk hits a creature with an unarmed attack, the target dies unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + Wisdom modifier + half the monk's level). Constructs and undead cannot be affected. The monk gains an additional use of Quivering Palm every six levels thereafter.
* 19th level: Empty Body. The monk can assume an incorporeal state for 5 rounds a number of times a day equal to their level divided by 2. While incorporeal, the monk can move through walls, and half the attacks that hit the monk deal no physical damage. The monk's unarmed attacks will ignore armor and shield bonuses.
* 20th level: Perfect Self. The monk has tuned their body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that they become a magical creature. They are forevermore treated as an outsider (extraplanar creature) rather than as a humanoid. For instance, charm person does not affect them. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 20/+1. This means that the monk ignores (instantly regenerates) the first 20 points of damage from any attack unless the damage is dealt by a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus (or better), by a spell, or by a form of energy (fire, cold, etc.). As an outsider, a 20th level monk is subject to spells that repel enchanted creatures, such as protection from law.

Disadvantages:
* Loses many bonuses if wearing armor and/or using weapons.~
@536    = ~Paladin~
@537    = ~PALADIN:

A paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true. Like the fighter, the paladin is a man of combat. However, the paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry. He strives to be a living example of these virtues so that others might learn from him as well as gain by his actions.

NOTE: Wisdom is the casting statistic for a paladin. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-10

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.
* Paladins may use Lay On Hands 1/Day. Lay On Hands heals the target for a number of hit points equal to the paladin's Charisma modifier times their paladin level (minimum of 1 point per level). It can also be used on an undead creature to deal damage to them, though that would require a successful melee touch attack. Paladins gain an additional casting every 5 levels.
* Paladins are immune to all forms of disease.
* 2nd Level: Adds Charisma modifier to all saving throws.
* 2nd Level: Spellcasting. Paladins gain the ability to cast spells.
* 2nd level: Smite Evil. Once per day, the paladin may now attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. They add their Charisma modifier (if positive) to their attack roll and deal a number of extra d4s equal to their paladin level plus their Charisma modifier. Paladins can smite evil an additional time every 10 levels.
* 2nd Level: Aura of Courage. Paladins become immune to fear, and allies within 10 feet receive a bonus of +4 to saving throws against fear effects.
* 3rd level: Remove Disease. The paladin gains the ability to remove disease from other characters a number of times per day equal to their level divided by 3.
* 3rd Level: Turn Undead. When this power is invoked, the paladin attempts to use the power of their patron deity to terrify a group of undead. The higher the paladin's level and charisma are, the greater their chance of success is. Though this ability is similar to the cleric's Turn Undead ability, the paladin's ability functions as though he or she were two levels lower than a cleric.

Disadvantages
* The paladin must be lawful good or neutral good in alignment and must choose a divine order. This choice of an order restricts the paladin's multiclassing possibilities.
* The paladin must react to evil deeds that occur in their presence.~
@538    = ~Ranger~
@539    = ~RANGER:

The ranger is a warrior and a woodsman. He is skilled with weapons and is knowledgeable in the ways of the forest. The ranger often protects and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk. A ranger needs to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life.

NOTE: Wisdom is the casting statistic for a ranger. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-10

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.
* Rangers may select a Favored Enemy at first level. They gain +1 to attack and +4 to damage against creatures of that race type. Rangers gain an additional Favored Enemy every five levels, and the attack bonus against previous Favored Enemies increases by 1.
* Rangers can fight with two weapons as if they had the feats Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting if they are wearing light or no armor only.
* 2nd level: Spellcasting. Rangers gain the ability to cast spells.
* 6th level: The ranger can take the Whirlwind Attack feat provided they meet the Dexterity requirement, ignoring all other requirements.
* 6th level: Set Natural Snare. This ability sets a trap that, which triggered by an enemy, ensnares all enemies within 20 feet for 5 rounds on a failed Reflex save. The save DC is 6 plus the ranger's Wilderness Lore skill. The ranger gains an additional use of Set Natural Snare every 6 levels after 6.
* 7th level: Woodland Stride. The ranger becomes immune to Entangle, Web, and Spike Growth.
* 9th level: The ranger can take the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot feats, even if they don't meet the prerequisites.
* 15th level: The ranger can take the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot feats a second time, which no other class can do.

Disadvantages:
* Rangers gain feats at a slower rate than fighters.
* Rangers do not start with proficiency in heavy armor.~
@540    = ~Rogue~
@541    = ~ROGUE:

To accomplish his goals, for good or ill, the rogue is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are his hallmarks. Whether he turns his talent against innocent passers-by and wealthy merchants or oppressors and monsters is a choice for the rogue to make.

Hit Points per Level: 1-6

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons, bows, and light armor.
* Rogues receive a larger number of skill points per level than any other character class. They can use these extra skill points to buy class skills like Disable Device to remove traps, Hide, Pick Pockets, and Use Magic Device.
* Sneak Attack: Rogues can sneak attack enemies to deal an additional 1d6 damage, plus 1d6 per 2 levels after level 1. An attack counts as a sneak attack if it hits an enemy in the back, if it occurs within 2 seconds of coming out of stealth or invisibility, or if the target is paralyzed, held, stunned, sleeping, confused, feebleminded, grappled, or feinted. Shortswords, throwing daggers, darts, shortbows, composite shortbows, light crossbows, slings, clubs and unarmed attacks deal an extra die of sneak attack damage. Melee daggers deal two extra dice of sneak attack damage.
* 2nd level: Evasion. When a rogue reaches 2nd level, he or she gains the ability to evade damage from area affect spells. Whenever a rogue makes a successful reflex save against an area effect spell that allows a reflex save for half damage, he or she takes no damage.
* 3rd level: Uncanny Dodge. Rogues retain their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class if they are attacked by invisible foes.
* 6th level: Improved Uncanny Dodge: Rogues can't be Sneak Attacked by another rogue unless the attacker is four or more levels higher.
* 10th level: Bonus Feat. The rogue gains a bonus feat, and also gains access to a number of new feats available only to rogues. These include Crippling Strike, Improved Evasion, Slippery Mind, Defensive Roll, and Opportunist.
* 13th level: Bonus Feat.
* 16th level: Bonus Feat.
* 19th level: Bonus Feat.
* 22th level: Bonus Feat. This is the last bonus feat, as by this point the rogue can obtain all five of the special feats first obtainable at level 10.
* Rogues gain +1 to luck every 5 levels.

Disadvantages:
* Rogues have no spellcasting ability and poor toe-to-toe combat ability.~
@542    = ~PAINBEARER OF ILMATER:

Ilmater, also known as the Crying God, is the god of suffering and perserverance. Taught that enduring the suffering of others is the greatest act of sacrifice, Painbearers of Ilmater can be found wherever the weak are oppressed. Painbearers are known for their charity, humility, and their unshaking faith during even the most trying of circumstances.

Advantages:

* Soothing Touch 1/day (heals 2d8+5 hit points and cures poison, disease, bleeding wounds, and pain effects)
* 6th level: Can cast Ilmater's Endurance 1/day (allows a non-evil ally to bear far more pain but also suffer more pain, granting them a +20 Constitution bonus and a -3 vulnerability to physical damage for 8 hours)~

@543    = ~GHOSTWISE HALFLING:

Ghostwise halflings are the feral, reclusive cousins of lightfoot and strongheart halflings. They are found most often in the southern forests of the Realms living in small communities. Ghostwise halflings are rarely seen in large cities, but occasionally set out to explore the world for reasons known only to them. Visitors to ghostwise settlements often report that the halflings have kinship so tight with their fellows that they can communicate without speaking.

Favored Class: Barbarian

Advantages:
* +2 to Dexterity.
* +2 to Move Silently checks.
* +1 to hit with slings and thrown weapons.
* +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear.
* Gains 1.5 times their Strength bonus to damage with slings and thrown weapons, as one would with two-handed weapons.

Disadvantages:
* -2 Intelligence.
~

@544    = ~STORMLORD OF TALOS:

Talos the Destroyer is the god of storms and destruction. The bane of many rangers and druids, Talos works his evil through the use of his priests, the Stormlords. Stormlords terrorize farming communities all across Faerun with threats of imminent doom if all do not appease the Destroyer. They are known for their abusive terrorism and their foolhardy nature.

Advantages:

* 5/- Electrical Resistance
* Talos' Blessing 1/Day (for 5 rounds, all electrical damage dealt by the priest is increased by 30%)~
@545    = ~BATTLEGUARD OF TEMPUS:

The Lord of Battles, Tempus, is worshipped by warriors across the Faerun. As war can be found in almost every civilized part of the world, so too can the Battleguards of Tempus. Battleguards fight bravely and inspire their comrades to deeds of valor. They are known for their bravery and stubborn nature.

Advantages:

* Automatically gains Martial Weapon: Axe and Weapon Focus: Axe feats.
* Tempus' Mastery 1/day (recipient gains +6 attack and damage with all weapons for 3 rounds)~
@546    = ~WATCHER OF HELM:

Also known as He of the Unsleeping Eyes, Helm is the god of guardians. His servants, the Watchers, are always vigilant against invaders, thieves, and tricksters of all sorts. Watchers are known for their stern demeanor, loyalty, and uncompromising ethics.

Advantages:

* Helm's Shield 1/day (grants the recipient a +4 generic AC bonus for 10 rounds plus 1 round per cleric level)
* Helm's Watch 1/day (allows the recipient to see invisible creatures and grants them immunity to sleep, blindness, fatigue and sneak attacks for 30 rounds)~
@547    = ~SILVERSTAR OF SELUNE:

Selune is often called the Moonmaiden for her connection to the silver moon that orbits Faerun. She is the goddess of the moon and travelers. Her priests, called Silverstars, travel far and wide to help the oppressed and explore lost places. Silverstars are known for their open-minded tolerance and their hatred of bigotry.

Advantages:

* Selune's Freedom 1/day (grants the recipient Freedom of Movement for 5 rounds/level)
* Moon Shield 1/day (grants the recipient 20/- Magic Damage Resistance for 5 rounds/level)~
@548    = ~MORNINGLORD OF LATHANDER:

Lathander the Morninglord is the god of the dawn and renewal. His priests, who share his title, can be found around the world helping communities grow and rebuild after times of trouble. Morninglords are known for their kindness and optimism.

Advantages:

* Improved Turning Feat
* Lathander's Renewal 1/day (heals 6x cleric level in hit points and cures energy drain)~

@560    = ~PALADIN OF ILMATER:

Paladins of Ilmater venerate the god of suffering. They willingly take the most horrible wounds in any battle just to prevent the suffering of others. They are typically known for their humility.

Advantages:
* 2nd level: The paladin can cast Shield Other (which halves the damage an ally takes, causing the paladin to take the other half) at will.
* 6th level: The paladin's healing spells and abilities heal 50% more hit points if used on an ally other than the paladin.
* 11th level: The bonus to healing spells and abilities is increased from 50% to 100%.~
@561    = ~PALADIN OF HELM:

Paladins of Helm follow the teachings of the god of guardians. They are dedicated to defending the weak and protecting important places against assault.

Advantages:
* 2nd level: While using the Guard action, the paladin and all allies within 20 feet gain a +2 AC bonus.
* 6th level: The AC bonus from using the Guard action increases to +4.
* 11th level: While using the Guard action, the paladin can see through illusions as per True Sight.~
@562    = ~PALADIN OF MYSTRA:

Paladins of Mystra insure that the powers of the goddess of magic are not used for evil. They seek out evil spellcasters all over Faerun for the protection of civilization and to protect benign wizards from the repercussions of irresponsible magic use.

Advantages:
* 2nd level: The paladin gains one rank in Armored Arcana, reducing their arcane spell failure by 35%.
* 6th level: The paladin gains two more ranks in Armored Arcana, reducing their arcane spell failure by a total of 105% (allowing them to cast arcane spells with no chance of failure while wearing the heaviest armor and shields).
* 11th level: All fire, cold, electricity, acid, and magic damage dealt by the paladin is increased by 20%. This stacks with feats like Spirit of Flame and Master of Magic Force. This bonus applies to both spells like Fireball and abilities like Smite Evil.~
@563    = ~MONK OF THE OLD ORDER:

Members of the Old Order do not worship any particular deity, but are fond of philosophical debates and introspection.

Advantages:
* 2nd level: The monk now adds their Wisdom bonus again to the DC of Stunning Attack.
* 18th level: The monk now adds their Wisdom bonus again to the DC of Quivering Palm.~
@564    = ~MONK OF THE BROKEN ONES:

Members of the Order of the Broken Ones venerate Ilmater, god of suffering. They strive to endure the pain of their training as well as the pain of others.

Advantages:
* 2nd level: The monk gains one use of Lay on Hands per day. Any level that would give the monk a use of Wholeness of Body instead gives them another use of Lay on Hands. When used by a Monk of the Broken Ones, Lay on Hands restores the same amount of HP as Wholeness of Body (monk level * Wisdom bonus) but can be used on other creatures as well.
* 6th level: The monk gains 2/- resistance to all physical damage. Another 1/- resistance is gained every 4 levels thereafter.~
@565    = ~MONK OF THE DARK MOON:

Members of the Order of the Dark Moon worship Shar, goddess of darkness and loss. They use their monastic training as a route to personal and spiritual power.

Advantages:
* 2nd level: The monk gains one use of Darkness per day. Any level that would give the monk a use of Wholeness of Body instead gives them another use of Darkness. The DC is equal to 15 + Wisdom bonus + half the character's monk level. The monk also adds half their monk level to the DC of any other Darkness spell or ability they cast. The monk can see perfectly even in magical darkness.
* 10th level: The monk gains +1 damage against any enemy that is blinded or has their vision impaired by a Darkness effect. For every 8 monk levels after level 10, the monk gains another +1 damage against enemies in these situations.~
@566    = ~Monk of the Black Raven~
@567    = ~MONK OF THE BLACK RAVEN:

The Order of the Black Raven was founded by Valas the Black Raven, a half-drow formerly enslaved in the Underdark. Using his legendary martial arts skills, he escaped slavery and fought his way to the surface world. Monks who follow the Black Raven's example have a central goal: to fight against slavery.

Advantages:
* 2nd level: The monk gains +2 to damage against enemy groups that commonly practice slavery, such as drow, duergar, mind flayers, yuan-ti, devils, Thayvians, and followers of Bane and Iyachtu Xvim. For every 4 monk levels after level 2, the monk gains another +1 damage against these enemies.~

@569    = ~SORCERER:

Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they even are the spawn of dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than wizards, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way wizards do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to the wizard.

NOTE: A sorcerer does NOT learn spells from scrolls. He chooses new spells with each level. Charisma is the casting statistic for a sorcerer. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-4

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons.
* 6th level: The sorcerer may replace one of their known spells with another spell of the same level. They may do this once again every 2 levels after level 6. The sorcerer can only replace spells at least two spell levels below the highest spell level they can cast (e.g. only a 1st-level spell when the sorcerer reaches 6th level), though they can replace 8th-level spells starting at level 20, and 9th-level spells starting at level 22.

Disadvantages:
* Starts with no proficiencies in armor and is very poor at melee combat.~
@570    = ~BARD:

The bard's strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Hit Points per Level: 1-6

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. The bard is also proficient with large swords.
* Gains one point in Armored Arcana, reducing arcane spell failure by 35%.
* +1 to Alchemy, Knowledge (Arcana) and Spellcraft.
* 2nd level: Spellcasting. Bards gain the ability to cast arcane spells.
* Many rogue like skills are class skills of the Bard.
* Bard Songs. Bards have the ability to sing melodies that have magical effects on creatures within thirty feet. As they advance in level, they gain additional songs. The songs are described in detail below.
* 1st level: The Tale of Curran Strongheart. When played, all the bard's allies gain +1 attack bonus, +1 damage, and immunity to fear and hopelessness. The attack and damage bonuses increase by 1 at levels 10, 25 and 40.
* 3th level: The Song of Kaudies. When played, the bard's allies are immune to harmful sound-based spells and abilities, including Command, Silence, Greater Command, Holy Word, Blasphemy, Power Word: Sleep, Sound Burst, Shout, Power Word: Silence, Power Word: Stun, Power Word: Blind, Great Shout, Wail of the Banshee, Power Word: Kill, harpy wails, and the enemy-only effects of Chant, Prayer, and Recitation.
* 5th level: Tymora's Melody. When played, Tymora's Melody gives the bard's allies +1 luck, +1 saving throws, and +2 to their Knowledge(arcana), Alchemy, and rogue skills. At levels 15 and 35, this song grants an additional +1 to luck and saving throws and +2 to skill checks.
* 9th level: The Siren's Yearning. When played, every creature that hears the song suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to their Will saves for 10 rounds and must make a Will save or be entralled, unable to take action for one round or until they take damage. The Will save DC is equal to the bard's level. Thus, a level 15 bard's song has a DC of 15.
* 13th level: The War Chant of Sith. When played, the bard's allies gain a +2 generic armor bonus, physical damage resistance of 3/-, and they regenerate 3 points of damage per round in combat. At levels 28 and 45, this song grants an additional +2 to AC, 3/- physical damage resistance, 3 hit points healed per round.
* 20th level: The Ballad of Three Heroes. When played, the bard's allies gain +5 spell resistance, 5/- resistance to all forms of magical damage, and the effects of the Tale of Curran Strongheart, Tymora's Melody, and the War Chant of Sith. At levels 30 and 50, this song grants an additional +5 spell resistance and 5/- resistance to magical damage.

A bard cannot benefit the party with more than one song at once. But if the party has multiple bards, the effects of each bard's song will stack. Summoned creatures do not benefit from bard songs.

* 30th level: The bard can now do other actions while singing a bard song.

Disadvantages:
* Bards are not as effective in hand-to-hand combat as warriors or priests.
* Bards have slower access to spells than a wizard or priest.~
@571    = ~WIZARD:

The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. However, the most common sort studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His broad range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring.

Note: To cast a spell, a wizard must have an Intelligence equal to or greater than the spells level plus 10. Intelligence is the casting statistic for a wizard.  It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-4

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons except for simple missile weapons.
* Receives a bonus feat every five levels in addition to the normal feats given to all character classes every three levels.
* If the character does not specialize in a school of magic, they gain a +1 bonus to the DC of all their spells.

Disadvantages:
* Starts with no proficiencies in armor and is a very poor at melee combat.~

If your Dexterity is higher than your Strength, you attempt to trip the target, which must make a Reflex save (DC 7 + half your base attack bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or fall down for 4 seconds. Otherwise, you try to knock down your target, which must make a Fortitude save (DC 7 + half your base attack bonus + your Strength modifier) or fall down for 4 seconds. The DC gets -4 for each time someone has tried to knock down or trip the target in the past 10 rounds. It also gets -4 if the target has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid (such as a dwarf). Creatures more than one size category larger than you (whose circle is more than twice as large as your circle) cannot be knocked down or tripped. The time spent to perform this ability causes you to have one fewer attack in the following round.~
@948    = ~Improved Feint~
@949    = ~Improved Feint

This ability can be used once per round. The target must make a Will save (DC 12 + your Bluff skill). The DC gets -4 for each time someone has tried to feint the target in the past 10 rounds. On a failure, for 4 seconds, the target loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, and it gains additional penalties to Armor Class and attack rolls equal to one third of your Bluff skill, rounded down. Improved Feint may be used as a free action once per round.~
@950    = ~Whirlwind Attack

This ability can be used once per round. You make an attack with each of your weapons against each nearby enemy, forgoing all other attacks for the round. The radius of the attack depends on the reach of your weapon.~
@951    = ~Improved Whirlwind Attack~
@952    = ~Improved Whirlwind Attack

This ability can be used once per round. You make an attack with each of your weapons against each nearby enemy, forgoing all other attacks for the round. The radius of the attack is equal to the reach of your weapon plus 5 feet.~
@953    = ~Counterspell

This ability can be used once per round. If you use it on an enemy spellcaster when they are casting a spell you also have memorized, you can expend one use of that spell to counter the enemy's spell, causing it to fail.~
@954    = ~Lay on Hands

Lay on Hands heals the target for a number of hit points equal to the paladin's Charisma modifier times their paladin level (minimum of 1 point per level). Paladins gain an additional casting of Lay on Hands every 5 levels.~
@955    = ~Lay on Hands (Monk)

When used by a Monk of the Broken Ones, Lay on Hands restores the same amount of HP as Wholeness of Body (monk level * Wisdom bonus) but can be used on other creatures as well.~
@956    = ~Shield Other

This ability creates a mystic connection between the paladin and the target so that some of their wounds are transferred to the paladin. Whenever the target would take damage, they only take half the damage; the other half is taken by the paladin. The damage is only split this way if the paladin and target can see each other. Shield Other lasts 5 rounds plus 3 rounds per level. This ability can be used at will.~
@957    = ~Enlarge Self

This ability causes the duergar to temporarily grow twice as large in each dimension. The duergar gains +8 Strength and Constitution; these are size bonuses which stack with other bonuses to these attributes. The duergar's speed is also increased (since they cover more distance with each stride). However, the duergar also gets a -4 penalty to Dexterity, AC, and attack rolls due to increased size. The duergar cannot benefit from invisibility, blur, or mirror image while under this effect. Enlarge Self lasts 1 round per level.~
@958    = ~Widen Spell

This metamagic increases the radius of the next spell you cast by 50%. It will take up a spell slot one level higher. Metamagic abilities can be used as a free action any number of times per day.~
@959    = ~Maximize Spell

This metamagic causes the next spell you cast to deal maximum damage or heal the maximum number of hit points. It will take up a spell slot three levels higher. Metamagic abilities can be used as a free action any number of times per day.~
@960    = ~Extend Spell

This metamagic makes the next spell you cast last twice as long. It will take up a spell slot one level higher. Extend Spell cannot extend spells that have a base duration of less than five rounds. Metamagic abilities can be used as a free action any number of times per day.~
@961    = ~Safe Spell

This metamagic prevents the next spell you cast from harming allies. It will take up a spell slot one level higher. Metamagic abilities can be used as a free action any number of times per day.~

@963    = ~Quicken Spell

This metamagic allows you to instantly cast your next spell, even if you've already cast a spell for the round. It will take up a spell slot two levels higher. You may only quicken one spell per round. Metamagic abilities can be used as a free action any number of times per day.~
@964    = ~Persistent Spell

This metamagic causes the next spell you cast to last 8 hours. It will take up a spell slot six levels higher. Persistent Spell cannot affect spells that have a base duration of less than five rounds. Metamagic abilities can be used as a free action any number of times per day.~
@965    = ~Mass Spell

This metamagic causes the next spell you cast to affect all creatures in a 20-foot radius (friend or foe). It will take up a spell slot five levels higher. Mass Spell replaces the spell's original projectile or area of effect, which means it does not work well with spells that already have an area of effect. Metamagic abilities can be used as a free action any number of times per day.~
@966    = ~Natural Form

The character returns to their normal form.~
@967    = ~Protection from Evil

This ability forms a magic barrier around the target creature, granting a bonus of +2 generic bonus to AC and saving throws against attacks, spells and abilities from evil creatures. In additions, the creature is immune to charm and domination effects. Summoned fiends will not attack their summoner or their summoner's allies if their summoner has Protection from Evil. This version of Protection from Evil lasts 10 rounds per level.~
@968    = ~Remove Disease

When this ability is placed on a diseased individual, it immediately cures them and restores 5 lost hit points.~
@969    = ~Smite Evil

By using this ability, the paladin will attempt to smite evil with their next melee attack. They add their Charisma modifier (if positive) to their attack roll and deal a number of extra d4s equal to their paladin level plus their Charisma modifier, provided the target is evil.~
@970    = ~Sunscorch

Upon completion of this ability, a brilliant ray of scorching heat fires down from the sky and burns the target creature for 1d6 + 1 fire damage per level of the caster (to a maximum of 1d6 + 15). Undead creatures and monsters vulnerable to bright light take 1d6 + 2 fire damage per level of the caster (to a maximum of 1d6 + 30). Victims must make a successful Fortitude save or be blinded for 3 rounds. Drow and gray dwarves are blinded from the spell for 3 rounds (no save).~
@971    = ~Darkness

This ability creates magical darkness in the area of effect. Creatures without darkvision must make a Fortitude saving throw or be effectively blinded. Creatures with darkvision aren't blinded, but even they have only a limited ability to see through magical darkness, getting a -4 attack penalty on a failed save. Creatures with superior 120 foot darkvision (e.g. drow, gray dwarves or deep gnomes) only get a -2 attack penalty. Devils and creatures immune to blindness are unaffected.~
@972    = ~Invisibility

This ability turns the character invisible and makes them undetectable by normal vision or darkvision. The spell remains in effect until 10 minutes per level have expired, it is magically broken or dispelled, or until the character talks to or attacks any creature. Thus they can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if they attack or cast a spell, they immediately become visible (although the invisibility enables them to attack first).~
@973    = ~Set Natural Snare

This ability sets a trap that, which triggered by an enemy, ensnares all enemies within 20 feet for 5 rounds on a failed Reflex save. The save DC is 6 plus the ranger's Wilderness Lore skill.~
@974    = ~Maximized Attacks

All attacks do maximum damage for 5 rounds. If you have 12 or more fighter levels, you also gain a +4 attack bonus and +4 critical threat range for the duration.~
@975    = ~Stunning Attack

When this ability is used, all of the character's unarmed attacks in the next round force the victim to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Wisdom modifier + half the character's monk level) or be stunned for 1 round.~
@976    = ~Quivering Palm

This terrifying attack allows the monk to set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can be fatal. The next time the monk hits a creature with an unarmed attack, the target dies unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + Wisdom modifier + half the monk's level). Constructs and undead cannot be affected.~
@977    = ~Barbarian Rage

By entering a rage, the barbarian gains +4 to Strength and Constitution (which stack with other bonuses to Strength and Constitution), as well as a -2 AC penalty, +2 to Will saves, and immunity to fear, stun, sleep, charm, domination, confusion, unconsciousness, paralysis, feeblemind, and hopelessness. The rage lasts for 3 rounds + a number of rounds equal to the barbarian's (newly improved) Constitution bonus. After raging the barbarian will be fatigued for three rounds, giving them a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity.~
@978    = ~Greater Barbarian Rage

By entering a rage, the barbarian gains +6 to Strength and Constitution (which stack with other bonuses to Strength and Constitution), as well as a -2 AC penalty, +3 to Will saves, and immunity to fear, stun, sleep, charm, domination, confusion, unconsciousness, paralysis, feeblemind, and hopelessness. The rage lasts for 3 rounds + a number of rounds equal to the barbarian's (newly improved) Constitution bonus. After raging the barbarian will be fatigued for three rounds, giving them a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity.

The bonuses increase at higher levels:

21st level: +8 to Strength and Constitution and +4 to Will saves.
25th level: +10 to Strength and Constitution and +5 to Will saves.
29th level: +12 to Strength and Constitution and +6 to Will saves.~
@979    = ~Wholeness of Body

With this ability, the monk can regain hit points equal to their monk level times their Wisdom modifier.~
@980    = ~If you drop something on the ground instead of a container, it will eventually disappear after many hours have passed. Key items will not disappear this way.~
@981    = ~In cramped fighting situations, use spears, halberds, quarterstaves, greatswords, and two-handed axes to attack enemies from a distance. Spears in particular have the longest reach of these weapons.~
@982    = ~If you have difficulty with a battle, try using spells like Bless, Cat's Grace, Haste, and Emotion: Hope before you engage the enemy.~
@983    = ~Right-click the inventory button to toggle quickloot, which lets you pick up items much faster.~
@984    = ~Darkness

This ability creates magical darkness in the area of effect. Creatures without darkvision must make a Fortitude saving throw or be effectively blinded. Creatures with darkvision aren't blinded, but even they have only a limited ability to see through magical darkness, getting a -4 attack penalty on a failed save. Creatures with superior 120 foot darkvision (e.g. drow, gray dwarves or deep gnomes) only get a -2 attack penalty. Devils and creatures immune to blindness are unaffected.

When used by a Monk of the Dark Moon, Darkness has a DC of 15 + Wisdom bonus + half the character's monk level. Any other Darkness spell or ability used by a Monk of the Dark Moon also gains a bonus to DC equal to half the character's monk level.~

Drinking this potion can soothe nearly any ailment, from common infection to lethal venom to an ugly hangover. The quartz binds to toxic substances and turns them into harmless salt, curing poison, disease, and intoxication.

By pouring the vial onto one's arm and speaking the command word, the user spreads a radiant prismatic liquid across his or her body, granting 5/- resistance to all forms of fire damage. The liquid is enchanted to cling to the user's skin, but the effect will wear off after 10 rounds.

This black oil is a modified version of one such narcotic. When drunk Black Mania will induce a violent state of confusion, granting the user a +3 bonus to damage rolls and melee attack rolls at the cost of a -3 penalty to AC and missile attacks.

The sodium catches fire on contact with the water, setting the rest of the mixture alight.

Left out at night over the course of 1-7 days (depending on the available moonlight), this potion will put the drinker in a partially spectral state, granting him or her near-immunity to mundane weapons.

@4732     = ~Haunted Ether~
@4733     = ~Both complex engineering and mystical study are necessary to create this bottle of enchanted gas. The alchemist must first invest in a fractional distillation column to collect the necessary gas from the atmosphere. Once the gas is collected, it must be infused with one or more hostile spirits. Reciting blasphemies in a graveyard is sufficient if the alchemist is well-versed in Abyssal or is familiar with the teachings of the most popular deity among the dead; otherwise the alchemist must resort to graverobbing, and conduct various illegal and unpleasant rituals with exhumed corpses.

If the alchemist successfully enrages the local spirits, he or she may bind them to the collected gas. Delivering repeated electrical charges to the imprisoned spirits will gradually disorient them, allowing the bottle to be thrown just like a grenade. When the bottle shatters, the spirits will lash out at the closest living creatures they can find, dealing 4d12 magic damage with a Fortitude save for half and inflicting fear on any victim who fails a Will save.

@4740     = ~Purified Ichor~
@4741     = ~Ichor can come from many sources, but the most convenient source is the bloodstream of a Bhaalspawn. In its unaltered state, the blood is little different from any other--extracting its true power is a complex process.

First, the Alchemist must conduct research into the parent deity and design a ritual to activate the hidden potential of the ichor. From there, the essence must be filtered out by leeching the blood with mummy wrappings, distillation, and precipitation in a centrifuge, producing a sweet-smelling golden liquid... or, in the case of ichor from evil deities, a foul mixture of grease and coarse dust.

Consuming the resulting substance is usually fatal; the purified ichor must be diluted and adapted to the user's system to have any positive effect. The exact method depends on the user, and requires intensive research and testing to discover. If the user is lucky, the method might be as harmless as crushing up some pearls and mixing the ichor with pumpkin juice and butter to produce an odd-flavored but perfectly drinkable potion.

If the user is unlucky, administering the dose might require vivisection.

Regardless of the method, the final result is a violent twisting of the digestive tract and the spread of the ichor through the user's body. The process is immensely painful and draining, permanently lowering the user's Constitution by 1 and dealing 10d10 poison damage with a save vs. death at -4 for half damage. If the user survives the process, he or she gains +1 to Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as the divine ichor suffuses their system.

If the user dies in the process, he or she may try again after being resurrected, but once the attempt is successful, further doses will have no affected on the imbued character.

The user must open the bottle and inhale deeply, holding the gas in their lungs until the plasma is absorbed into the bloodstream.

The wielder may throw the bottle much like a grenade, bypassing any armor or shield bonuses the target may possess. Any creature unfortunate enough to touch the fumes will suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to spell resistance as the enchantment seeps into their system, rendering them vulnerable to hostile spells.

The concoction is extremely toxic when drunk normally, so the would-be drinker must build up a tolerance by taking small sips of the milk over the course of several days. Violent seizures, fits of vomiting, and terrifying hallucinations are typical side effects of the process.

Once the user adjusts to the toxins, however, he or she may use the negative energy in the vampire milk to close their wounds. This bitter potion heals 6d10 hit points with every bottle.

@4756     = ~Moldy Poultice~
@4757     = ~This poultice is a small jar of very fertile soil topped with a lush green moss. An alchemist must take special care when cultivating this moss, constantly making sure it has just the right amount of water and nutrients to thrive. Singing lullabies, burning incense, and paying compliments to the moss are all critical parts of the process.

Nurtured with love and blessed with plenty of exposure to moonlight, this moss will develop a faint glow. If the alchemist has treated it well, the moss will gladly spend its precious energy to bring a dead creature back to life.

Its power spent and its personality sacrificed for the sake of the alchemist's fallen comrade, the moss will lose its glow. The user is well advised to throw the moss away--keeping it around tends to make one somber, and the moss wouldn't want its best friend to be sad.

This allows the user to cast more than one spell in a single round, though each one will suffer a -3 penalty to spellcasting speed. After 2 rounds, the user's eyes will return to their normal form and the effect of the potion will wear off.
