@539    = ~RANGER:

The ranger is a warrior and a woodsman. He is skilled with weapons and is knowledgeable in the ways of the forest. The ranger often protects and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk. A ranger needs to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life.

NOTE: Wisdom is the casting statistic for a ranger. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-10

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.
* Rangers may select a Favored Enemy at first level. They gain +1 to attack and +4 to damage against creatures of that race type. Rangers gain an additional Favored Enemy every five levels, and the attack bonus against previous Favored Enemies increases by 1.
* Rangers can fight with two weapons as if they had the feats Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting if they are wearing light or no armor only.
* 2nd level: Spellcasting. Rangers gain the ability to cast spells.
* 6th level: The ranger can take the Whirlwind Attack feat provided they meet the Dexterity requirement, ignoring all other requirements.
* 6th level: Set Natural Snare. This ability sets a trap that, which triggered by an enemy, ensnares all enemies within 20 feet for 5 rounds on a failed Reflex save. The save DC is 6 plus the ranger's Wilderness Lore skill. The ranger gains an additional use of Set Natural Snare every 6 levels after 6.
* 7th level: Woodland Stride. The ranger becomes immune to Entangle, Web, and Spike Growth.
* 9th level: The ranger can take the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot feats, even if they don't meet the prerequisites.
* 15th level: The ranger can take the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot feats a second time, which no other class can do.

Disadvantages:
* Rangers gain feats at a slower rate than fighters.
* Rangers do not start with proficiency in heavy armor.~

Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Reflex half

Upon completion of this spell, the caster becomes a focus of spiritual energy, which then shoots out from the caster in four directions, like lightning bolts.

This spell is especially useful when a mage is surrounded by enemies, and it will not provoke an attack of opportunity.

All creatures in the area of effect except for the caster are burned for 1d6 fire damage per caster level (15d6 maximum, 12d6 minimum).  A successful Reflex save halves the damage.  This spell blinds drow and gray dwarves if a Fortitude save is failed. This spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.~
@55377=~This character's body has been destroyed. A Resurrection spell will be needed to bring them back to life; Raise Dead will not suffice.~
@55378=~This character's soul has been captured. The vessel for their soul must be destroyed before they can be brought back to life.~
@523    = ~WIZARD:

The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. However, the most common sort studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His broad range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring.

Note: To cast a spell, a wizard must have an Intelligence equal to or greater than the spells level plus 10. Intelligence is the casting statistic for a wizard.  It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-4

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons except for simple missile weapons.
* Receives a bonus feat every five levels in addition to the normal feats given to all character classes every three levels.
* If the character does not specialize in a school of magic, they gain a +1 bonus to the DC of all their spells.
* Learns two new spells each time they level up, and can also learn spells from scrolls.

Disadvantages:
* Starts with no proficiencies in armor and is a very poor at melee combat.~
@527    = ~BARD:

The bard's strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Hit Points per Level: 1-6

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. The bard is also proficient with large swords.
* Gains one point in Armored Arcana, reducing arcane spell failure by 35%.
* +1 to Alchemy, Knowledge (Arcana) and Spellcraft.
* 2nd level: Spellcasting. Bards gain the ability to cast arcane spells.
* 7th level: The bard may replace one of their known spells with another spell of the same level. They may do this once again every 3 levels after level 7. The bard can only replace spells at least two spell levels below the highest spell level they can cast (e.g. only a 1st-level spell when the bard reaches 7th level), though they can replace 7th-level spells starting at level 25, and 8th-level spells starting at level 28.
* Many rogue like skills are class skills of the Bard.
* Bard Songs. Bards have the ability to sing melodies that have magical effects on creatures within thirty feet. As they advance in level, they gain additional songs. The songs are described in detail below.
* 1st level: The Tale of Curran Strongheart. When played, all the bard's allies gain +1 attack bonus, +1 damage, and immunity to fear and hopelessness. The attack and damage bonuses increase by 1 at levels 10, 25 and 40.
* 3th level: The Song of Kaudies. When played, the bard's allies are immune to harmful sound-based spells and abilities, including Command, Silence, Greater Command, Holy Word, Blasphemy, Power Word: Sleep, Sound Burst, Shout, Power Word: Silence, Power Word: Stun, Power Word: Blind, Great Shout, Wail of the Banshee, Power Word: Kill, harpy wails, and the enemy-only effects of Chant, Prayer, and Recitation.
* 5th level: Tymora's Melody. When played, Tymora's Melody gives the bard's allies +1 luck, +1 saving throws, and +2 to their Knowledge(arcana), Alchemy, and rogue skills. At levels 15 and 35, this song grants an additional +1 to luck and saving throws and +2 to skill checks.
* 9th level: The Siren's Yearning. When played, every creature that hears the song suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to their Will saves for 10 rounds and must make a Will save or be entralled, unable to take action for one round or until they take damage. The Will save DC is equal to the bard's level. Thus, a level 15 bard's song has a DC of 15.
* 13th level: The War Chant of Sith. When played, the bard's allies gain a +2 generic armor bonus, physical damage resistance of 3/-, and they regenerate 3 points of damage per round in combat. At levels 28 and 45, this song grants an additional +2 to AC, 3/- physical damage resistance, 3 hit points healed per round.
* 20th level: The Ballad of Three Heroes. When played, the bard's allies gain +5 spell resistance, 5/- resistance to all forms of magical damage, and the effects of the Tale of Curran Strongheart, Tymora's Melody, and the War Chant of Sith. At levels 30 and 50, this song grants an additional +5 spell resistance and 5/- resistance to magical damage.

A bard cannot benefit the party with more than one song at once. But if the party has multiple bards, the effects of each bard's song will stack. Summoned creatures do not benefit from bard songs.

* 30th level: The bard can now do other actions while singing a bard song.

Disadvantages:
* Bards are not as effective in hand-to-hand combat as warriors or priests.
* Bards have slower access to spells than a wizard or priest.~
@569    = ~SORCERER:

Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they even are the spawn of dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than wizards, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way wizards do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to the wizard.

NOTE: A sorcerer does NOT learn spells from scrolls. He chooses new spells with each level. Charisma is the casting statistic for a sorcerer. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-4

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons.
* 6th level: The sorcerer may replace one of their known spells with another spell of the same level. They may do this once again every 2 levels after level 6. The sorcerer can only replace spells at least two spell levels below the highest spell level they can cast (e.g. only a 1st-level spell when the sorcerer reaches 6th level), though they can replace 8th-level spells starting at level 20, and 9th-level spells starting at level 22.

Disadvantages:
* Starts with no proficiencies in armor and is very poor at melee combat.~

The caster makes ranged touch attacks against each of those creatures; each one that get hit must Save vs. Fortitude or lose all but one hit point.

(Transmutation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 8, Helm 8
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting him several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster has 15/- resistance to fire, cold, and all forms of physical damage, but also +15 vulnerability to electricity. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored completely, such as poison, blindness, deafness, and disease to name a few, and the caster becomes too heavy to knock back with spells like Gust of Wind, Throw or Repulsion. In addition, the caster gains a +8 bonus to strength and constitution and a -8 dexterity penalty. Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward under the weight of his new body, setting his movement rate to half its normal rate, and he receives a -2 penalty to casting speed.~

The target's Spell Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

Benefit: You gain an ability that lets you knock down or trip an adjacent creature. The ability can be used once per round. If your Dexterity is higher than your Strength, you attempt to trip the target, which must make a Reflex save (DC 5 + half your base attack bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or fall down for 4 seconds. Otherwise, you try to knock down your target, which must make a Fortitude save (DC 5 + half your base attack bonus + your Strength modifier) or fall down for 4 seconds. The DC gets -4 for each time someone has tried to knock down or trip the target in the past 10 rounds. It also gets -4 if the target has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid (such as a dwarf). Creatures larger than you cannot be knocked down tripped. The time spent to perform this ability causes the character to have one fewer attack in the following round.

This feat may be taken twice. When taken a second time, the feat is Improved Knockdown, which adds a +2 bonus to the DC, and allows you knock down or trip creatures one size category larger than you (creatures whose circle has no more than twice the radius of your circle).~
@389    = ~LICHDOM:

After endless dark research, you have finally achieved immortality... so long as your phylactery survives.

Prerequisite: To start taking ranks in this feat, you need two ranks in Spell Focus: Necromancy, 12 levels of wizard or sorcerer or 10 levels of necromancer, and evil alignment. To take the final rank, you need 20 levels of wizard or sorcerer or 18 levels of necromancer.

Benefit: Even after you meet the initial requirements, you must take this feat five times for it to have any benefit (this represents the long hours of evil research necessary to achieve lichdom). Once you do, you become a lich and gain these effects:
* +5 generic armor bonus.
* +2 Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.
* Immune to cold, electricity, poison, disease, bleeding, fatigue, sleep, fear, hopelessness, charm, confusion, feeblemind, paralysis, stun, energy drain, instant death, petrification, polymorph effects, critical hits, and sneak attacks.
* 5/- resistance to slashing and piercing damage, damage reduction 5/+1.
* +8 bonus to Hide, Move Silently, and Search.
* You can be turned, but count as 4 levels higher against turning effects.
* You take damage from Cure Wounds spells and healing potions but are healed by Inflict Wounds spells.
* Your unarmed attacks are replaced with a Lich Touch, which deals 3d10+5 cold damage and paralyzes the target for 10 rounds on a failed save (same DC as the spell Lich Touch).
* You have an aura of fear; any enemy within 20 feet that is at least 5 levels lower than you must make a Will save (DC 10 + Charisma/Intelligence modifier) or run away for 1 round.
* You gain a phylactery which stores your life force. If you die, you will be automatically revived after 8 hours. However, if all party members die, the enemies will destroy your phylactery and the game will be over.~
@390    = ~LICHDOM:

@704    = ~GRAPPLE:

While anyone can grapple something, you have the skill to grapple even a hostile creature in the midst of combat.

Benefit: You gain an ability that lets you grab an adjacent creature. The ability can be used once per round. The target must make a Reflex save (DC 12 + half your level + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (whichever is higher)) or be grappled by you for 2 rounds. While grappled, the creature gets a -4 attack penalty, a 50% chance of spell failure, and cannot move away from you. If you move, you may pull the creature along with you.

To grapple, you must have at least one hand free. The save gains +4 DC if you have both hands free. It gets -4 DC for each time someone has tried to grapple the target in the past 10 rounds. If you grapple an ally or a paralyzed, stunned, sleeping, or knocked down creature, there is no save. Creatures larger than you cannot be grappled.~
@730    = ~DODGE:

You are adept at dodging blows.

Prerequisite: Dex 13+. Taking the feat a second time requires Dex 25+, Improved Evasion, and Defensive Roll.

Benefit: You receive a +1 dodge bonus to armor class against attacks from an opponent.

When taken a second time, the feat also allows you to automatically dodge the first attack that would hit you each round.~

Range: Close (30 ft. long, 10 ft. diameter)
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area: 30-feet long, 10-foot diameter
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

The caster emits an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area of effect is deafened for 5 rounds, stunned for 2 rounds, and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and stun and reduces the damage by half. A deafened creature has a 50% chance of resisting this spell.~
@1145    = ~Lich Touch
(Necromancy)
Level: Sor/Wiz 6
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Fortitude half

This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch. The wizard's hands are imbued with a chilling force of negative energy, allowing the caster to deal 3d10+5 cold damage (plus damage bonuses from Strength, proficiencies, spells, items and other effects) with each hit and paralyze living victims for 10 rounds on a failed Fortitude save. The attack uses the Simple Weapon: Small Blade/Touch Attack proficiency.~
@1497    = ~Eagle's Splendor
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 2, Drd 2, Pal 2, Sor/Wiz 2, Oghma 1
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 hour / level
Casting Time: 1 
Target: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None 

The transmutated creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The spell grants +4 to Charisma, adding the usual benefits of Charisma-based skills and abilities.~
@1622    = ~Great Shout
(Evocation)
Level: Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 8, Oghma 7
Range: Caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: 30-feet long, 10-foot diameter
Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Upon uttering the Great Shout, the caster releases a stunning force from their mouth in a 30-foot long, 10-foot diameter cone. Creatures within the area of effect take 10d10 sonic damage with a Fortitude save for half. Those who fail the save are stunned for 5 rounds and deafened for 10 rounds. Deafened creatures have a 25% chance of resisting this spell.~
@34623     = ~Mass Haste
(Transmutation)
Level: Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

Mass Haste grants the effects of the 3rd-level spell Haste to all allies in the area of effect. Those allies gain +4 AC and an extra attack per round, and move twice as fast. These effects do not stack with the 3rd-level spell. Mass Haste dispels Slow effects.~
@38252     = ~Sound Burst
(Evocation)
Level: Brd 2
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

This spell releases an extremely loud and jarring burst of sound. Creatures in the area of effect take 1d8 sonic damage and must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. Deaf creatures are not stunned but still take damage. The caster is unaffected by this spell.~
@1009    = ~Tortoise Shell
(Abjuration) 
Level: Drd 3, Rgr 3
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

Upon completion of this spell, a large hemispherical shell resembling that of a tortoise encases the target creature, shielding it from the outside world. The creature encased can take no action but in turn is impervious to all effects. The tortoise shell has 50 hit points, plus another 50 hit points for every 10 levels the druid has attained. Tortoise Shell can only affect allies.~
@1679    = ~Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
(Evocation) 
Level: Sor/Wiz 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature. The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage; the only method of removing the sphere is by the use of a Dispel Magic spell. Hence the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world.~
@529    = ~CLERIC:

The cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the spiritual needs of a community. He is both protector and healer, though he is not totally defensive.

NOTE: Wisdom is the casting statistic for a cleric. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-8

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons as well as hammers, flails, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.
* Clerics can cast powerful defensive and healing spells.
* Clerics have the ability to Turn Undead. When this power is invoked, the cleric channels positive or negative energy, which has various effects on undead. The higher the cleric's level and charisma are, the greater his or her chance of success is. If the cleric is good, or a neutral follower of a non-evil deity, their turning causes undead to flee, or destroys them outright if the turn undead roll is high enough. If the cleric is evil, or a neutral follower of an evil deity, their turning causes hostile undead to cower before them, or takes control of the undead if the turn undead roll is high enough, while allied undead are instead bolstered, making them more difficult for enemy clerics to turn. If an allied undead has been turned by an enemy cleric, an evil cleric can dispel the turning with a turning on their own.
* Clerics receive special powers and spells from their deity.
* Spontaneous Casting: Clerics can convert their spells to cure (if good or neutral) or inflict (if evil) spells of the nearest level when a player shift-clicks on a spell at the time of casting. The spell clicked is immediately removed from the character's memorized list and cast as the nearest cure or inflict spell of the same level.

Spontaneous Casting Spells:
1: Cure Light Wounds/Inflict Light Wounds
2: Cure Moderate Wounds/Inflict Moderate Wounds
3: Cure Serious Wounds/Inflict Serious Wounds
4: Cure Critical Wounds/Inflict Critical Wounds
5: Raise Dead/Slay Living
6: Heal/Harm
7: Resurrection/Destruction
8: Greater Restoration/Energy Drain
9: Mass Heal/Mass Harm

Disadvantages:
* Clerics do not have access to many powerful offensive spells.
* Clerics are weaker in combat than fighters, rangers, paladins, and barbarians.~

Use this skill to keep a guard dog from barking at you, to get a wild bird to land on your outstretched hand, or to keep an owlbear calm while you back off.

This weapon is all that remains of Slow Cedric's Gallop, a small frontier settlement located in the Southern Pass of the Spine of the World Mountains. The settlement is believed to have been overrun by a tribe of orcs in the great winter of 1170 DR, and when the cold season passed, the settlement and the bodies of the townsfolk had been buried beneath great mountains of snow. When the first travelers braved the Pass in the spring season, they found only the top of the settlement's great stone belltower peeking through the mountainous drifts. This odd-looking flail was found lying upon the tower's bloodied stone floor, surrounded by the frost-dusted bodies of several dead orcs.

According to tales, the Black Chimes were a symbol of office of the settlement's Bell Warden, whose duty was two-fold - to ring the warning bell when an enemy was sighted in the pass, and after the warning bell had been rung, to defend the pass with his life. It is believed the first Bell Warden of Slow Cedric's Gallop was the original creator of the Black Chimes, an enchanted flail that would ring to warn the town of danger at the same time as he leapt into battle against his foes.

@98   = ~You must first install the core component.~
@535    = ~MONK:

Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best-known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

NOTE: Multiclassed monks ONLY use their monk levels when determining their number of attacks when fighting unarmed.

Hit Points per Level: 1-8

Advantages:
* The monk attacks at a faster rate than other characters while unarmed:

Level 1-3: 2 attacks per round
Level 4-6: 3 attacks
Level 7-9: 4 attacks
Level 10-12: 5 attacks
Level 13-15: 6 attacks. For every 3 levels after 13, the monk gains another attack per round.

* Monk Weapons: The monk can wield quarterstaves, daggers, throwing daggers, and darts with very few penalties (one fewer attack per round than with fists, but the monk will still get an extra attack per round every 3 levels).

* As the monk increases in levels, the damage their fists inflicts does as well:

Level 1-2: 1d6
Level 3-4: 1d8
Level 5-7: 1d8+1
Level 8-10: 1d8+2
Level 11-13: 1d8+3
Level 14-16: 1d8+4
Level 17+: 1d8+5

* Ki Strike: At level 5, the monk's unarmed attack is empowered with ki, and gains +1 enchantment with corresponding bonuses to attack and damage. This enchantment bonus increases by +1 every 3 levels after level 5, up to +5 at level 17.
* A monk's natural armor class starts at 10, and then increases by +1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
* When not wearing armor (robes are acceptable) a monk adds their Wisdom bonus to their AC in the same manner as their Dexterity bonus. If the monk is shapeshifted, they will only gain this benefit if their monk level is greater than or equal to the minimum level required to shapeshift into that form.
* Stunning Attacks: When this ability is used, all of the monk's unarmed attacks in the next round force the victim to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Wisdom modifier + half the monk's level) or be stunned for 1 round. A monk can make a stunning attack 1/day/level.
* Evasion: Monks have the ability to evade damage from area of effect spells. Whenever a monk makes a successful Reflex save against an area effect spell that allows a reflex save for half damage, he or she takes no damage.
* 2nd level: Deflect Arrows. The monk gains the Deflect Arrows feat, yielding a +1 miscellanous bonus against missile weapons. In addition, the monk automatically blocks the first instance of missile damage that would hit them each round. The monk must have a hand free to block missiles this way.
* 3rd level: Fast Movement. The monk moves 10 feet faster than a normal character (normal movement speed is 30 feet), but only as long as the monk is not encumbered or wearing armor. The monk gains another 10 feet of movement every 3 levels thereafter.
* 3rd level: Still Mind. The monk gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells and effects from the Enchantment school.
* 5th level: Purity of Body. The monk gains control over their body's immune system. They gain immunity to all diseases.
* 7th level: Wholeness of Body. The monk can regain hit points equal to their monk level times their Wisdom modifier once each day per seven levels.
* 9th level: Improved Evasion. The monk gains the Improved Evasion feat that is normally only available to rogues.
* 10th level: Abundant Step. The monk may teleport to any location in sight once per day.
* 11th level: Diamond Body. The monk is in such control of their own metabolism that they gain immunity to poison of all kinds.
* 13th level: Diamond Soul. The monk gains spell resistance. Their spell resistance equals their level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must roll the monk's spell resistance or higher on 1d20 + the spellcaster's level.
* 15th level: Quivering Palm. This terrifying attack allows the monk to set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can be fatal. The next time the monk hits a creature with an unarmed attack, the target dies unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + Wisdom modifier + half the monk's level). Constructs and undead cannot be affected. The monk gains an additional use of Quivering Palm every six levels thereafter.
* 19th level: Empty Body. The monk can assume an incorporeal state for 5 rounds a number of times a day equal to their level divided by 2. While incorporeal, the monk can move through walls, and half the attacks that hit the monk deal no physical damage. The monk's unarmed attacks will ignore armor and shield bonuses.
* 20th level: Perfect Self. The monk has tuned their body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that they become a magical creature. They are forevermore treated as an outsider (extraplanar creature) rather than as a humanoid. For instance, charm person does not affect them. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 20/+1. This means that the monk ignores (instantly regenerates) the first 20 points of damage from any attack unless the damage is dealt by a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus (or better), by a spell, or by a form of energy (fire, cold, etc.). As an outsider, a 20th level monk is subject to spells that repel enchanted creatures, such as protection from law.

Disadvantages:
* Loses many bonuses if wearing armor and/or using weapons.~

Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Reflex half 

A Grease spell covers the ground with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

This spell turns a creature invisible and makes it undetectable by normal vision or darkvision. The spell remains in effect until the duration has expired, it is magically broken or dispelled, or until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature.

@34321     = ~Invisibility Sphere
(Illusion) 
Level: Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3, Mask 3
Range: Caster
Duration: 10 rounds / level
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes all creatures within 10' of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even darkvision.  Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.  Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until the duration has expired. Thus the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first.~

Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 20 rounds
Casting Time: 12

Malavon's Corrosive Fog is another spell created by the dark elf sorcerer Malavon. It creates an enormous cloud of acid fog that lingers for a long time. Each round, any creature in the fog takes 12d6 acid damage (Fortitude save for half), and their movement rate is halved (there is no save against the movement penalty). The target's Spell Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@389    = ~LICHDOM:

After endless dark research, you have finally achieved immortality... so long as your phylactery survives.

Prerequisite: To start taking ranks in this feat, you need two ranks in Spell Focus: Necromancy, 12 levels of wizard or sorcerer or 10 levels of necromancer, and evil alignment. To take the final rank, you need 20 levels of wizard or sorcerer or 18 levels of necromancer.

Benefit: Even after you meet the initial requirements, you must take this feat five times for it to have any benefit (this represents the long hours of evil research necessary to achieve lichdom). Once you do, you become a lich and gain these effects:
* +5 generic armor bonus.
* +2 Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.
* Immune to cold, electricity, poison, disease, bleeding, fatigue, sleep, fear, hopelessness, charm, confusion, feeblemind, paralysis, stun, energy drain, instant death, petrification, harmful polymorph effects (Polymorph Self still works), critical hits, and sneak attacks.
* 5/- resistance to slashing and piercing damage, damage reduction 5/+1.
* +8 bonus to Hide, Move Silently, and Search.
* You can be turned, but count as 4 levels higher against turning effects.
* You take damage from Cure Wounds spells and healing potions but are healed by Inflict Wounds spells.
* Your unarmed attacks are replaced with a Lich Touch, which deals 3d10+5 cold damage and paralyzes the target for 10 rounds on a failed save (same DC as the spell Lich Touch).
* You have an aura of fear; any enemy within 20 feet that is at least 5 levels lower than you must make a Will save (DC 10 + Charisma/Intelligence modifier) or run away for 1 round.
* You gain a phylactery which stores your life force. If you die, you will be automatically revived after 8 hours. However, if all party members die, the enemies will destroy your phylactery and the game will be over.~

@11583    = ~Protean Hammer +3~
@11584    = ~This hammer was created by an ingenious gnomish inventor and wizard named Airon Broune. Actually no one really knows if Airon is a gnome or not because no one has actually seen him. Apparently overnight he had taken over an abandoned shop at the edge of small town. One day the shop was vacant and then the next it was boarded up tight with signs in every language telling passersby to go away. Infuriated, the previous owner demanded he leave, but quickly relinquished his claim to the shop when a large sack of gold appeared at his feet. The very next day, mysterious notes began to appear all over town. They all contained the same message and read as follows:

**************************************

Bring potatoes. Will pay in gold.

-Airon Broun

**************************************

Intrigued, a few townspeople decided to take him up on his offer and delivered sacks of potatoes to the shop. They would shove the potatoes into a delivery chute located in the back of the shop and then soon after a small sack of gold would appear, usually five times the going rate of the potatoes. The better the quality of the potatoes the more gold would appear. News soon spread of this wonderful offer and it was not long until every potato in town was sold to the curious gnome. No matter how many potatoes one delivered, there always appeared a sack of gold for payment. 

Needless to say, every farm for miles around started growing potatoes. Each farmer would try to outdo the other by producing the biggest and tastiest potatoes. This continued on for years until finally, the quality of potatoes was so good that instead of gold appearing, magic items of all sorts would appear. Not realizing the magical nature of the items given, the farmers sold them to passing merchants in disgust and stopped farming potatoes altogether. This hammer is one such item. By inserting special enchanted plates into the head of the hammer, the user is able to modify the abilities of the hammer. This particular hammer comes with plates that will do extra acid, cold, or fire damage.

(Transmutation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 6
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

This spell turns a living creature to stone on a failed Fortitude save. The effects of this spell may be reversed with the 6th level wizard spell, Stone to Flesh. This spell has no effect on undead.~
@38457     = ~Chaos Cast
(Universal)
Level: Sor/Wiz 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell casts a random wizard spell on the target creature, which could be a spell of any level between 5 and 8. The nature of the spell depends on the target. If the target is an enemy, they will receive a harmful spell, but if the target is an ally, they will receive a beneficial spell. Targeting restrictions are obeyed (a spell that can only target the caster will not be rolled unless the target is the caster).

The main advantage of Chaos Cast is that the random spell will be higher than level 4. The disadvantage is that the spell might not be useful in the current situation.~

(Abjuration)
Level: Drd 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the recipient to absorb elemental attacks, healing instead of taking damage. For the duration, if the target would take fire, cold, electrical or acid damage, they instead heal Hit Points equal to the damage they would have taken.~
@37866     = ~Clone~
@38866     = ~Clone
(Necromancy)
Level: Sor/Wiz 8
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Permanent until used
Casting Time: 20
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

A dubious alternative to resurrection, this spell creates an inert duplicate of a party member. After the spell is cast, the clone requires 8 hours to grow into a suitable replacement for the original character. Once that time has passed, if the original character dies (or is already dead) while in the same area as the clone, their soul will be transferred to the clone, which will join the party with the exact same stats and abilities of the original character. A party member cannot have more than one inert clone in the same area at one time.

Clone can be cast on a living party member, or it can be cast targeting a dead character's portrait.~
@94     = ~Add PnP Wizard Spell Learning and Bard/Sorcerer Spell Replacement systems~
@570    = ~BARD:

The bard's strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Hit Points per Level: 1-6

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. The bard is also proficient with large swords.
* Gains one point in Armored Arcana, reducing arcane spell failure by 35%.
* +1 to Alchemy, Knowledge (Arcana) and Spellcraft.
* 2nd level: Spellcasting. Bards gain the ability to cast arcane spells.
* Many rogue like skills are class skills of the Bard.
* Bard Songs. Bards have the ability to sing melodies that have magical effects on creatures within thirty feet. As they advance in level, they gain additional songs. The songs are described in detail below.
* 1st level: The Tale of Curran Strongheart. When played, all the bard's allies gain +1 attack bonus, +1 damage, and immunity to fear and hopelessness. The attack and damage bonuses increase by 1 at levels 10, 25 and 40.
* 3th level: The Song of Kaudies. When played, the bard's allies are immune to harmful sound-based spells and abilities, including Command, Silence, Greater Command, Holy Word, Blasphemy, Power Word: Sleep, Sound Burst, Shout, Power Word: Silence, Power Word: Stun, Power Word: Blind, Great Shout, Wail of the Banshee, Power Word: Kill, harpy wails, and the enemy-only effects of Chant, Prayer, and Recitation.
* 5th level: Tymora's Melody. When played, Tymora's Melody gives the bard's allies +1 luck, +1 saving throws, and +2 to their Knowledge(arcana), Alchemy, and rogue skills. At levels 15 and 35, this song grants an additional +1 to luck and saving throws and +2 to skill checks.
* 9th level: The Siren's Yearning. When played, every creature that hears the song suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to their Will saves for 10 rounds and must make a Will save or be entralled, unable to take action for one round or until they take damage. The Will save DC is equal to the bard's level. Thus, a level 15 bard's song has a DC of 15.
* 13th level: The War Chant of Sith. When played, the bard's allies gain a +2 generic armor bonus, physical damage resistance of 3/-, and they regenerate 3 points of damage per round in combat. At levels 28 and 45, this song grants an additional +2 to AC, 3/- physical damage resistance, 3 hit points healed per round.
* 20th level: The Ballad of Three Heroes. When played, the bard's allies gain +5 spell resistance, 5/- resistance to all forms of magical damage, and the effects of the Tale of Curran Strongheart, Tymora's Melody, and the War Chant of Sith. At levels 30 and 50, this song grants an additional +5 spell resistance and 5/- resistance to magical damage.

A bard cannot benefit the party with more than one song at once. But if the party has multiple bards, the effects of each bard's song will stack. Summoned creatures do not benefit from bard songs.

* 30th level: The bard can now do other actions while singing a bard song.

Disadvantages:
* Bards are not as effective in hand-to-hand combat as warriors or priests.
* Bards have slower access to spells than a wizard or priest.~
@571    = ~WIZARD:

The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. However, the most common sort studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His broad range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring.

Note: To cast a spell, a wizard must have an Intelligence equal to or greater than the spells level plus 10. Intelligence is the casting statistic for a wizard.  It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.

Hit Points per Level: 1-4

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple weapons except for simple missile weapons.
* Receives a bonus feat every five levels in addition to the normal feats given to all character classes every three levels.
* If the character does not specialize in a school of magic, they gain a +1 bonus to the DC of all their spells.

Disadvantages:
* Starts with no proficiencies in armor and is a very poor at melee combat.~
@222    = ~Expertise

When you use this ability, you may choose to gain an AC bonus of up to +5, and an attack penalty of the same amount. The bonus you choose may not exceed your base attack bonus, and only applies while you are attacking with a melee weapon.~
@525    = ~BARBARIAN:

From the frozen wastes of the north and the hellish jungles of the south come brave, even reckless, warriors. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly throw himself into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent.

Hit points per level: 1-12

Advantages:
* Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.
* Barbarian Rage: Can rage once per day per every 4 levels (starts at 1st level with one use). Rage gives them +4 to Strength and Constitution (which stack with other bonuses to Strength and Constitution), as well as a -2 AC penalty, +2 to Will saves, and immunity to fear, stun, sleep, charm, domination, confusion, unconsciousness, paralysis, feeblemind, and hopelessness. The rage lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 plus the barbarian's (newly improved) Constitution bonus. After raging the barbarian will be fatigued for three rounds, giving them a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity.
* Fast Movement: Barbarians can move 10 feet faster than a standard character, provided they are not encumbered or wearing heavy armor.
* 2nd level: Damage Reduction. The barbarian gains 1/- point of resistance to slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage. He or she gains 1/- additional point of resistance at levels 5, 8, 11, and every 3 levels thereafter. If the barbarian wears medium armor, the damage reduction granted by this feature is doubled.
* 2nd level: Uncanny Dodge. Barbarians retain their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class if they are attacked by invisible foes.
* 5th level: Improved Uncanny Dodge. Barbarians cannot be Sneak Attacked by rogues unless the attacker is at least four levels higher than the barbarian.
* 15th level: Greater Rage. All of the barbarian's rages become greater rages, which increase the strength and constitution bonuses to +6 and the saving throw bonus to +3. He or she still receives the -2 AC penalty.
* 20th level: Tireless Rage. The barbarian is no longer fatigued after a rage.
* 21st level: Mighty Rage. The barbarian's rage ability now grants +8 to Strength and Constitution and +4 to Will saves.
* 25th level: Barbarian rage now grants +10 to Strength and Constitution and +5 to Will saves.
* 29th level: Barbarian rage now grants +12 to Strength and Constitution and +6 to Will saves.

Disadvantages:
* Barbarians gain feats at a slower rate than fighters.
* Barbarians do not start with proficiency in heavy armor.~
@977    = ~Barbarian Rage

By entering a rage, the barbarian gains +4 to Strength and Constitution (which stack with other bonuses to Strength and Constitution), as well as a -2 AC penalty, +2 to Will saves, and immunity to fear, stun, sleep, charm, domination, confusion, unconsciousness, paralysis, feeblemind, and hopelessness. The rage lasts for 3 rounds + a number of rounds equal to the barbarian's (newly improved) Constitution bonus. After raging the barbarian will be fatigued for three rounds, giving them a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity.~
@978    = ~Greater Barbarian Rage

By entering a rage, the barbarian gains +6 to Strength and Constitution (which stack with other bonuses to Strength and Constitution), as well as a -2 AC penalty, +3 to Will saves, and immunity to fear, stun, sleep, charm, domination, confusion, unconsciousness, paralysis, feeblemind, and hopelessness. The rage lasts for 3 rounds + a number of rounds equal to the barbarian's (newly improved) Constitution bonus. After raging the barbarian will be fatigued for three rounds, giving them a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity.

The bonuses increase at higher levels:

21st level: +8 to Strength and Constitution and +4 to Will saves.
25th level: +10 to Strength and Constitution and +5 to Will saves.
29th level: +12 to Strength and Constitution and +6 to Will saves.~

@565    = ~MONK OF THE DARK MOON:

Members of the Order of the Dark Moon worship Shar, goddess of darkness and loss. They use their monastic training as a route to personal and spiritual power.

Advantages:
* 2nd level: The monk gains one use of Darkness per day. Any level that would give the monk a use of Wholeness of Body instead gives them another use of Darkness. The DC is equal to 15 + Wisdom bonus + half the character's monk level. The monk also adds half their monk level to the DC of any other Darkness spell or ability they cast. The monk can see perfectly even in magical darkness.
* 10th level: The monk gains +1 damage against any enemy that is blinded or has their vision impaired by a Darkness effect. For every 8 monk levels after level 10, the monk gains another +1 damage against enemies in these situations.~
@984    = ~Darkness

This ability creates magical darkness in the area of effect. Creatures without darkvision must make a Fortitude saving throw or be effectively blinded. Creatures with darkvision aren't blinded, but even they have only a limited ability to see through magical darkness, getting a -4 attack penalty on a failed save. Creatures with superior 120 foot darkvision (e.g. drow, gray dwarves or deep gnomes) only get a -2 attack penalty. Devils and creatures immune to blindness are unaffected.

When used by a Monk of the Dark Moon, Darkness has a DC of 15 + Wisdom bonus + half the character's monk level. Any other Darkness spell or ability used by a Monk of the Dark Moon also gains a bonus to DC equal to half the character's monk level.~

@729    = ~STUNNING ATTACK:

You know how to strike opponents in vulnerable areas.

Prerequisites: Dex 13+, Wis 13+, base attack bonus +8 or higher

Benefit:  When attacking with Stunning Attack, it forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + one-half your monk level if any + Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally.  If the defender fails his saving throw, he is stunned for 1 round.  A stunned character can't act and can be hit automatically.  You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained.~

Saving Throw: None

A weaker version of the 6th-level spell Divine Shell, this spell creates a magicial field around the caster that has a 20% chance to deflect missile attacks aimed at the caster. This includes not just ranged weapon attacks, but also certain spells, including Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Melf's Acid Arrow, Flame Arrow, Alicorn Lance, Icelance, Lance of Disruption, Mordenkainen's Force Missiles, Vitriolic Sphere, Otiluke's Freezing Sphere, and Sol's Searing Orb.~

(Abjuration)
Level: Sor/Wiz 8
Range: 5 feet
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 12
Area of Effect: 40-foot long, 28-foot thick wall
Saving Throw: None

One of the few abjuration spells that is capable of harm, this spell creates a thick, shimmering wall composed of seven layers of different colors. The wall can be passed through, but any creature other than the caster that walks through the wall will suffer a harmful effect for each layer they pass through.

The  effects of the seven colored layers are akin to a Prismatic Spray spell: red (inflicts 10d6 hit points of fire damage, Reflex for half), orange (10d6 hit points of acid damage, Reflex save for half), yellow (10d6  hit points of electrical damage, Reflex for half), green (Fortitude save or die - survivors still take 20 hit points of poison damage), blue (Fortitude or turn to stone), indigo (Will save or go insane), or violet (Will save or be warped to another plane and back again instantaneously with the lasting effects of having 5 levels drained). All saves made against this spell have -8 DC.

A creature that passes through a layer of the wall cannot be affected by that layer again for 10 rounds. Only one prismatic wall can be active at a time.~

Targos: Three or fewer ships, perhaps a few dozen infantry and archers. Two priests at the temple pavilion, with recruits drawn in from Luskan. The goblin's seizure of the waterways seems to have closed off the passage of further reinforcements. I have heard no mention of planned reinforcements from elsewhere into the city. The diviner in Targos should be taken care of by our friends from Luskan.

Bremen: The city should fall soon. Targos is unable to move ships across the bay thanks to our scrag allies. According to wounded soldiers from Bremen, they will not be able to hold out. You should be able to pull in forces from the north without worrying about attacks from Bremen.

Bryn Shander: With our forces in the field and the Shaengarne Ford held, the capital is unable to effectively provide the peripheral towns with supplies. The bugbears' use of hit and run tactics against caravans moving between the Ten-Towns has made it almost impossible for them to reinforce each other. Lonelywood has sent almost all of its able-bodied men south to Bryn Shander instead of sending them to Targos. The same has happened in Easthaven. Both towns should be ripe for taking should we choose to enlarge our grasp of the region. Perhaps three to four hundred men wait in Bryn Shander along with a handful of volunteers from Clan Battlehammer. Most of those are militia, with a few experienced mercenaries among them. We need not worry about Silverymoon and the other communities to the east. Only two volunteers have arrived, and those are already out of the action.

//The two strings below must be translated to be indentical to the line in the description of an armor or shield that states its armor or shield bonus, minus the number. The mod runs code that checks the description of armor and shields for a line that includes one of these strings (but doesn't include the "Generic Armor Bonus:" line) and puts the above string right below them.

@12920    = ~This hammer was made by a self-styled prophet of providential rejection. His name was Phellep, and he believed that the actions of the individual were of no consequence to the fate of humanity as a whole.

The hammer he carried with him was used to pound on the doors of churches, what he called "the dens of fools and mindless men."

@12924    = ~The Foolsmiter has a huge stone head in the shape of a rectangular block. Faint traces of gore and blood are on all sides of the hammer's head. The shaft is of a thick wood that looks too weak to support the hammer head's weight. The Foolsmiter has a unique enchantment: it hits harder against foes that are stupider than the wielder.
