@192    = ~Belib's Multiple Tool~
@193    = ~Belib the Wary was a very bright gnome, and self-proclaimed adventurer, who believed in covering every angle of his tiny arse before leaving on grand quests.  He created magical items that literally saturated the gamut of possible situations that could arise from his high adventures.  These magical items would have been the envy of all adventurers, had Belib been successful in leaving his domicile with his equipment.

After many years of creating his incredible inventory of enchanted do-dads, Belib finally gathered his wares into an immense backpack (naturally, it was enchanted to carry far more than what would normally fit into a gnome's pack) and set out to quest for the grandest quests.  Unfortunately for Belib, one of his tiny feet tripped over his home's threshold and he was summarily crushed under the enormous weight of his pack.  The backpack burst open and scattered his enchanted wares all across his front yard.  One would like to think that passing sentient beings would stop and help the crushed gnome, but the most that passersby did was loot Belib's goods.

One of Belib's more popular goodies, especially with the vermin that make stealing and looting a career, was Belib's Multiple Tool.  Disguised as an ornate amulet, this tool would help make even the most inept rogue a master of lock picking and trap disarming.  As is usually the case with items that aid in the thieving arts, Belib's Multiple Tool has found its way into many greased palms over the years.

Born in Sembia and raised in a musical family, Pellon Kay never took his performances seriously.  Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation.  Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing.  The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night.  As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body.  After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction.  He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks.  Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute.  The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

@204    = ~Viol of the Hollow Men~
@205    = ~This instrument is also known as "Tallow's Violin," but that moniker is rarely spoken among musicians, as mentioning the name of Nikolai Tallow is considered bad luck.  Nikolai was born in The Vast, near High Haspur, the son of a chandler.  Because of the intermittent traffic through the region, Nikolai was introduced to many different cultures.  One of the travelers he met was an elven musician named Relev Thinriver.  Relev introduced Nikolai to the violin and taught him for several years as he wandered through the area.  Relev knew that Nikolai was an incredibly gifted child, with quick fingers, a keen mind, and a passion for all things in the world.  Relev also recognized that Nikolai was exceedingly proud and arrogant.  In spite of Nikolai's shortcomings, Relev taught him everything he knew.

After Relev was killed by a band of orcs, Nikolai began to practice on his own throughout the Vast.  Despite his travels, he always returned to the isolate peaks of his mountain birthplace.  He became famed throughout the Vast, the southern Moonsea and Sembia for his incredible talent and passionate performances.  Eventually, news of the proud young virtuoso spread to the ears of a nearby thug from Calaunt named Tremble Ghon.  When Tremble and his gang traveled through the Elvenblood Pass, they stopped at the Elf in Armor Inn and demanded a performance from Nikolai, who happened to be present and eating dinner with his father at the time.

Nikolai refused to perform for Tremble and his men.  He called them stinking oafs and attempted to leave with dignity.  Tremble assaulted Nikolai's pride by claiming that Nikolai was afraid of performing because he'd be heckled out of the inn for his incompetence.  Nikolai shot back that his skill with the violin was so great that he could raise the dead from their graves.  Satisfied with a proposed challenge, Tremble immediately grabbed Nikolai's father and stabbed him in the heart.  When a number of other villagers attempted to intervene, they were also killed by the bandits.

Tremble defiantly stood over Nikolai's dead father and said, "Where's your big mouth now, fiddle player?"  Without a word, Nikolai pulled his violin and bow out from underneath his arms and began to play a melody that none of the residents of High Haspur had ever heard before, and no one in Faerun would ever hear again.  Nikolai played with unbridled passion and fervor.  Onlookers later remarked that he appeared to be a madman, thrashing about in ways that people didn't think were possible.  At the climax of his frenzied piece, Tremble and his gang watched in horror as the souls of the men and women they had just killed rose from their corpses and dove, shrieking, at their murderers.  The bandits died horrible deaths, chilled by the shadows of their victims.  Nikolai himself continued playing, dancing through the streets and back pastures of his alpine home until every man, woman, child, and beast ever buried in the region rose from its resting place and milled about until Nikolai and his music disappeared into a far off valley, shrouded in a mysterious fog that vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Legends say that on misty nights, the ghost of Nikolai Tallow returns to his homeland, playing a phantom violin with a host of dancing dead trailing behind him in the moonlight.

A cleric of Talos named Ylkath wore the Arcs for three decades before he died of old age.  His companion, the Umberlant priestess Ashalla of the Jade Tide, kept the belt for barely three years before she was shot dead by pirates that survived one of her nautical attacks.  The pirates sold the belt to a fence.  Its history past that point is unknown.

Much to his dismay, his mother's words became a part of the enchantment.  The dart did seem to work as intended, but occasionally would strike the user blind upon its return.

@283    = ~This odd pole-arm appears to be a cross between a halberd and a warhammer, fitted with a four-pronged hammerhead and a long thrusting spike.

Its creation was the result of a blunder made during the commission of an enchanted item for Lodur the Brave (alternately known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard), a powerful but none-to-bright cleric.  Lodur had of heard rumors of a mighty long-hafted hammer, possibly wielded by a hero known as Lucerne, or perhaps that's where it was made, which may or may not have had to do with a land or king or deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or "something of that nature, I am most certain."

"Oh," he had then added, "and pray thee bless it as well... thou dost know, that one where it explodes undead and what-not, so that I might smite things most explosively."

Lodur's fierce demeanor, violent reputation, and sacks of gold begged quiet compliance, and so the dwarven arms-master simply nodded and sent the cleric on his way, promising the weapon in two months' time.  The arm-master consulted with his clan's lore-master and sure enough, there *was* word of such a weapon: it came from a trader in Sigil by way of an exceptionally well-traveled plane-walker.  The arms-master dutifully copied the weapon's function and form, working runes of power into its haft and head just as Lodur had asked for.

When Lodur the Brave returned to the dwarven stronghold to pick up his new hammer, he found instead a spiked pole-arm whose use was forbidden by his religion.  The cleric ranted and gnashed his teeth and swore up and down the halls of the clan before stomping off in disgust, leaving his payment and the somewhat inappropriately named "Lucerne Hammer" behind.

 Belib the Wary was a very bright gnome, and self-proclaimed adventurer, who believed in covering every angle of his tiny arse before leaving on grand quests.  He created magical items that literally saturated the gamut of possible situations that could arise from his high adventures.  These magical items would have been the envy of all adventurers, had Belib been successful in leaving his domicile with his equipment.

After many years of creating his incredible inventory of enchanted do-dads, Belib finally gathered his wares into an immense backpack (naturally, it was enchanted to carry far more than what would normally fit into a gnome's pack) and set out to quest for the grandest quests.  Unfortunately for Belib, one of his tiny feet tripped over his home's threshold and he was summarily crushed under the enormous weight of his pack.  The backpack burst open and scattered his enchanted wares all across his front yard.  One would like to think that passing sentient beings would stop and help the crushed gnome, but the most that passersby did was loot Belib's goods.

One of Belib's more popular goodies, especially with the vermin that make stealing and looting a career, was Belib's Multiple Tool of Fortune.  Disguised as an ornate amulet, this tool would help make even the most inept rogue a master of lock picking and trap disarming.  As is usually the case with items that aid in the thieving arts, Belib's Multiple Tool has found its way into many greased palms over the years.

The weapon was also crafted with two special enchantments.  On a successful hit, there is a chance that Coward's Flight will cast a fear and a slow spell upon the target, causing them to turn their back and slowly flee.  This allows devastating attacks from an opponent's rear, thus the weapons name.

Coward's Flight was crafted by the dwarven smith Braegar of Dorn's Deep.

Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation.  Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing.  The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night.  As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body.  After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction.  He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks.  Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute.  The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

This proved to be a gift of questionable wisdom, as Adron was quick to anger, and he promptly began to fling the darts at his students - only to find that the theorems had given the darts a sage-like accuracy when making their points. Fortunately for the students, they were as good at dodging darts as they were in dodging their studies, so except for a few pairs of soiled robes, there was little damage done. 

Adron's darts were encased in a special case at the school, only to be stolen as a university prank many years later.  Since then, the darts have been sighted throughout the realms, carrying Adron's theorems and quotes wherever they go.

@323    = ~Lady Roa was a woman thrice betrayed.  First by her lord father, who married her to Duke Sorim for political gain despite knowing that he would relentlessly torment young Roa.  Second by her abusive husband the duke, who planted assassins amongst her handmaidens... when Roa visited her dearest brother Remin - a powerful baron - the assassins murdered him as he slept and so his lands passed to the duke.  The third and final betrayal was at the hands of her sister Rana, who longed to take the duke, his riches, and eventually the royal crown for her own.  Rana entwined herself in a plot with Duke Sorim to slay the king, discredit the true heir as his bastard child with Roa, and thereby steal the throne.

Roa, still less than sixteen summers old, was bound with a ball and chain and cast into the duke's infamous dungeons to await the completion of her husband and sister's terrible scheme.  She sobbed and moaned day and night, her voice echoing through the keep's halls.   The duke soon grew incensed at her constant wailing and sent one of his Ducal Guard to beat little Roa into silence.  When the man arrived at the cell, he struck her across the face, shoved her to the ground and made to kick at her belly - but quick as that, Roa sprung up and strangled the man with her chains.

Moments later the willowy young girl burst into the duke's court and attacked him savagely.  His guards pelted her with bolts from their crossbows, but onwards she charged.  When she reached the Ducal Throne she tossed Sorim's champion aside like a broken doll, swinging the iron ball of her shackles with such strength that it stove in the shocked duke's thrice-enchanted breastplate of meteoric iron, driving shards of shattered ribs into his lungs and heart and killing him instantly.

No one is clear as to how the tale ends - some say that Roa then expired on the spot, her chest and back bristling with bolts, while others describe how her sister Rana leapt up and killed her with a dagger... a few optimistic souls even claim that Roa lived and spent the rest of her days in peaceful bliss.  Whatever the case, her shackles remain as a testament to her story.

The chains of Roa's shackles have been looped and wound together in such a way that one can wield them as a flail.  Crudely etched into the soft iron of the ball are the words "In Righteousness Lies My Strength."

Those unfortunate merchant ships that crossed paths with The Bouncing Rhonda were never able to outrun the cutter, were summarily boarded and their merchandise stolen.  

Now, the fact that Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard and his hearty men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully pirated ships was not so unusual.  No, the unusual part was that after the men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully seized a merchant vessel, Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard would jump from the crow's nest, grab a rope in mid flight that was tied to the mast, gallantly swing down and land elegantly upon the deck of the merchant ship.  At almost the same time Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard's feet touched the merchant ship's deck, the captured crew took an instant liking to the pirate captain.  In fact, it was not uncommon for a majority of the captured crews to beg for a commission on The Bouncing Rhonda.  However, the instant the pirate captain and his crew left the merchant ship (along with its cargo), the remaining merchant ship's crew immediately resumed their hatred for the pirate captain.

No one knew why or how Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard managed to charm his victims so well.  That is, not until one day, while the good pirate captain was making one of his famous entrances via rope and mast, his colorful bandana flew off his near balding head.  The second his foot touched the deck, all the former merchant crews that went along with the pirate ship instantly came to their senses and summarily beat the pirate captain to death.  It did not take long for those around to realize that the pirate captain's bandana held magical properties that made him seem more charming.  

Unfortunately for the remaining pirate and merchant crew, the bandana flew into the sea.  However, rumors would pop up from time to time that a particularly dashing swashbuckler had the uncanny ability to charm his way out of trouble and liked to swing from mast ropes - and that he wore a very colorful bandana.

@344    = ~Cold Steel Reflection~
@345    = ~During the formation of the Circle of Ice resistance movement against the wizards of the Hosttower of the Arcane, many special rings were forged for the wizard slayers of the organization to help them fend off the magical powers of their opponents. 

The organization and the forging of the rings was sponsored by a merchant from Waterdeep whose name has been burned from the annals of history by the Hosttower.  Apparently, after being forced to debase himself before the Hosttower during a trading agreement in Luskan (and being forced to surrender much of his cargo), the merchant became obsessed with wiping the Hosttower from the face of Faerun.  Commissioning wizards in Waterdeep to fashion a score of rings for him, he set about using the last of his remaining wealth to hire a band of wizard slayers to bring about the downfall of the Hosttower.  These twenty wizard slayers made arrangements to travel north on their own and rendezvous with the merchant in Luskan. 

There was one wizard slayer named Martek, however, who ignored the rings offered by the merchant, and knowing the danger and guile of the Hosttower, instead commissioned a special ring from a dwarven ally that would provide him additional wards against spells and charms.  Once the other members of the Circle of Ice began to be murdered in Luskan after the Hosttower learned their identities, Martek used the power of his enhanced ring to shield himself from the scrying of the Hosttower wizards and escape southwards.  He eventually returned the ring to his dwarven ally, who sold it to a merchant making his way for Bryn Shander. 

This Cold Steel Reflection ring differs from the other Circle of Ice rings in that it seems to have a ring of steel beneath the icy exterior of the ring - much like Martek himself.

Upon the blade was inscribed "Know thy family," and Thomas took the motto to heart.  Bolstered by the sword and his mother's loss, he became determined to find Kresselack - whether out of a need for a new family to belong to or to take revenge on Kresselack for abandoning his mother, it is not known.   
 
When he found the Black Wolf, Kresselack spurned the young man, claiming that the sickly and weak-looking Thomas shared no blood with him, then ordered him beaten and left beneath the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn to die.  After two days in the freezing cold, Thomas was rescued by a tribe of Uthgart barbarians fleeing Kresselack's army.  Nursing the man back to health, the barbarians adopted Thomas into their tribe and he eventually became one of their greatest hunters.  When he passed away from winter chill many years later, he left his sword to his youngest son to help him find his way in the world.  

This powerful sword grants its user the ability to know the heart of an opponent's weakness.

Unfortunately, his mother had a habit of interrupting him at crucial points during the enchantment process, often with disastrous results.  Delnar's Healing Blade is another botched attempt by Delnar to construct something of use.

This weapon is truly an enigma.  When used in battle it does little to no damage, instead healing the intended target.  However, the healing is miniscule at best and hardly worth the effort required to swing the blade.  In any case, it has been given the name 'Delnar's Healing Blade' because of its inability to slay a target.

What purpose Delnar originally intended this weapon to serve is unknown.  There are some who argue that it functions as intended, while others laugh at the absurdity of this.

The oldest of dwarves speak of dykhast blades with tears of fond remembrance in their eyes, and callously spit at the mention of the "sundry weak and piddling'" metals that today's arms and armor are fashioned from.

There are rumors, though, of an ancient and secret temple called Chogoh Kyn - it is there, the tales say, that blades of dykhast are still made in the fashion of days long past.

The short sword's dark magic not only protects the wielder from the effects of magical webs, but can entangle a target with webs of its own as well.

An assassin typically uses the weapon to seal a target in a cocoon of silk, stepping away from their thrashing foe to complete the murder with a poisoned dart or wrist-crossbow bolt.  Such weapons have also helped many a would-be assassin flee from something that they've backstabbed but failed to kill with a single blow.

When the elder brother was named king by his dying sire, the younger was furious and vowed to take the throne as his own.  To this end he commissioned the making of Assassin's Blade to aid him in his brother's murder.

Many such tales exist throughout the realms and history.  Who is to say if they are fact or fiction?  In any case, Assassin's Blade is indeed a weapon of assassination.  The blade grants its wielder the ability to blend into the shadows and move as quiet as a cat stalking its prey.

This blade was reputedly given to a local warlord who sought to challenge the shogun, but the shogun was so contemptuous of the warlord's pretensions of being a threat that he invited him to his court and gave him the blade to both insult the man and as a warning for him to know his place.   

When drawn, this short, silvered blade has a broad base that tapers to a sharp point, but despite its apparent lightness, it is actually quite heavy.  It always looks like it is standing at attention and it has a curious way of drawing the eye in combat, unbalancing and distracting any opponents it meets in combat.

@410    = ~Cold Reflection~
@411    = ~Few have heard of the (literally) short-lived underground movement against the Hosttower of the Arcane called the Circle of Ice - nor the rings that came to mark the members of the organization, both in life and in death.  

The Circle of Ice was sponsored by a merchant from Waterdeep whose name has been burned from recorded history by the Hosttower.  Apparently, after being forced to debase himself before the Hosttower during a trading agreement in Luskan (and being forced to surrender much of his cargo), the merchant became obsessed with wiping the Hosttower from the face of Faerun.  Commissioning wizards in Waterdeep to fashion a score of rings for him, he set about using the last of his remaining wealth to hire a band of wizard slayers to bring about the downfall of the Hosttower.  These twenty wizard slayers made arrangements to travel north on their own and rendezvous with the merchant in Luskan. 

Ironically enough, the merchant never wore one of these rings, which was key in exposing and defeating the movement.  As soon as he returned to Luskan, his mind picked apart by telepaths and his movements scried, and each wizard slayer and accomplice were noted, identified, and ultimately led into deathtraps where their rings proved no match against the summoned monsters and arrows of slaying wielded by the ambush parties.  It is rumored that only one wizard slayer, Martek, escaped the Hosttower, and to this day, he has never been found, which has been a constant source of irritation to the mages. 

In any event, the Circle of Ice died a quick, silent death in Luskan, but the merchant lived on as a toy of the Hosttower, serving them until death, at which point, his corpse was stored in their laboratories.  It is most likely his preserved body will end up as the left arm of a flesh golem named Bok many years from now. 

These small bands of Cold Reflection appear to be made of crystallized ice, very cold to the touch, and they cannot be seen by a wizard unless the wizard knows they are there. 

If your band contains one that fancies him or herself a wizard slayer, perhaps these rings may be used for the purpose they were intended... but without the shortsightedness of foolish merchants handicapping your efforts.

Unfortunately, his mother had a habit of interrupting him at crucial points during the enchantment process, often with disastrous results.  Death's Bane is another botched attempt by Delnar to construct something of use.

This weapon is truly an enigma.  When used in battle it does little to no damage, instead healing the intended target.  However, the healing is miniscule at best and hardly worth the effort required to swing the blade.  In any case, it has been given the name 'Death's Bane' because of its inability to slay a target.

What purpose Delnar originally intended this weapon to serve is unknown.  There are some who argue that it functions as intended, while others laugh at the absurdity of this.

@478    = ~Lolth's Sting~
@479    = ~Blades such as this are often gifts to capable assassins in the service of Lolth.  The entire weapon is as black as pitch and reflects no light; its grip is textured with a delicate web pattern while hundreds of tiny spiders are engraved along the two-foot blade.  The short sword's dark magic not only protects the wielder from the effects of magical webs, but can entangle a target with webs of its own as well.

An assassin typically uses the weapon to seal a target in a cocoon of silk, stepping away from their thrashing foe to complete the murder with a poisoned dart or wrist-crossbow bolt.  Such weapons have also helped many a would-be assassin flee from something that they've backstabbed but failed to kill with a single blow.

When the elder brother was named king by his dying sire, the younger was furious and vowed to take the throne as his own.  To this end he commissioned the making of Silentkiller to aid him in his brother's murder.

Many such tales exist throughout the realms and history.  Who is to say if they are fact or fiction?  In any case, Silentkiller is indeed a weapon of assassination.  The blade grants its wielder the ability to blend into the shadows and move as quiet as a cat stalking its prey.

@483    = ~"Thy-Dunag" is an expression used in the distant realms of Kara-Tur to signify "more respect than is due," and this expression has been inscribed upon the hilt of this sword so that it may be seen even while the blade is sheathed.  This blade was reputedly given to a local warlord who sought to challenge the shogun, but the shogun was so contemptuous of the warlord's pretensions of being a threat that he invited him to his court and gave him the blade to both insult the man and as a warning for him to know his place.   

When drawn, this short, silvered blade has a broad base that tapers to a sharp point, but despite its apparent lightness, it is actually quite heavy.  It always looks like it is standing at attention and it has a curious way of drawing the eye in combat, unbalancing and distracting any opponents it meets in combat.

@575    = ~Mensel's Obscene Grimoire~
@576    = ~Mensel of Cormyr, at one time the Lord of Immersea, was that rare sort of nobleman, a fellow well known to be kind, generous, and humanitarian to a fault.  He was much loved by his family, servants, and those that lived upon his lands.  Well after the elderly Lord Mensel had passed away in his sleep, a secret vault was found hidden beneath his study.  Within the vault Mensel's heirs found a small hoard of treasure... and the Obscene Grimoire.

Though the origins of the grimoire and the identity of anyone associated with it - save the late Lord Mensel, of course - are still unknown, unwholesome rumors sprang up like mushrooms and still abound after nearly a century.  The worst of the scandalous claims involved a seer from Arabel, a pious young man that seemed saddened to explain that Lord Mensel had the grimoire fashioned for himself at great expense and then slew all those involved in its making - an assertion that did no less than bring ruin to Mensel's name and family.

The unsavory book was cast into a temple brazier but, to the astonishment of numerous witnesses, it vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling vapor rather than bursting into flames.  Since that day the Obscene Grimoire has appeared in many places, never found intentionally and always disappearing again within a few year's time.

The thick, black, leather-bound book is filled with painstakingly detailed woodblock prints, each depicting a gruesome scene of violent perversion.  Even the briefest of glances through its disturbing pages is enough to assure the reader that no taboo is left unturned.  However, for those willing to carefully peruse the disquieting work, there are dark runes and ritual directions hidden amongst the illumination around each print.  Those so inclined are able to use the power of Mensel's Obscene Grimoire to summon a cacofiend, bound to the reader's service, one time before the book vanishes.

@583    = ~Heart of Winter~
@584    = ~The Heart of Winter is often confused with the legendary Heartstone Gem, a powerful scrying artifact that serves as the heart of the great tree community of Kuldahar.  The Heart of Winter is not an object, but an expression frequently used by the Uthgart tribes of the north to refer to a warrior or creature that has rid itself of all except one driving focus - usually revenge or hatred.  The expression is often used to describe the barbarian lord, Wylfdene, who returned to lead the barbarian tribes in a campaign against the Ten-Towns in the Year of the Cold Soul (1281 Dale Reckoning).  According to legend, Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of the shaman Jerrod, one of the barbarians greatest heroes and the one who sacrificed himself in the final battle against the archmage Arakon many hundreds of years ago.  Claiming that his body had become home to Jerrod's spirit, Wylfdene rallied the tribes of the North to war to retake the lands that he claimed had been seized by the southerners of the Ten-Towns.  Establishing a great war camp in Bremen's Run, a narrow canyon under the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, he fought several quick battles against the dwarves and townsfolk of the region until a small band of adventurers arrived in the town of Lonelywood to try to carve out a peace between the Ten-Towns and the barbarians.  Their efforts at diplomacy are said to have failed, but they succeeded in defeating Wylfdene and saving the Ten-Towns from destruction.  It is believed that these adventurers are the only reason the Ten-Towns exist (and thrive) to this day. 

What happened to these brave adventurers is unknown.  The last known record of them is a sighting of them at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, where they spoke with a halfling traveler who claimed to know of a place where great riches could be found.  Shortly after this, the adventurers and the halfling vanished and were never heard from again. 

After reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell.  When a passage is recited from the book, it allows the reader to inflict the curse of the Heart of Winter upon foes, blinding them with its power or even freezing them where they stand.

@585    = ~Legends of Icewind Dale~
@586    = ~The greatest legends can stem from the humblest beginnings, and so it was with the band of adventurers that began their journey in the fishing community of Easthaven thirty years ago, 1281 Dale Reckoning.  Meeting in the Winter's Cradle Tavern, this band of southerners had traveled north in search of adventure, and they were the first to join Hrothgar's expedition to investigate the rumor of troubles brewing in the great tree town of Kuldahar to the North, where a mighty oak, towering hundreds of feet high, sheltered a small town beneath its boughs with a life-giving warmth.

The misfortunes plaguing Icewind Dale led to the ambush of Hrothgar's expedition in the windswept Kuldahar Pass... and it left them the only survivors.  Pressing on against goblinoid raiders that filled the Pass, the small band finally reached Kuldahar, only to discover the great tree was being threatened by an unknown evil deep within the mountains - if this evil was not stopped, Kuldahar would be destroyed, and the North itself might soon share the town's fate. 

The brave band of adventurers searched out this evil, their travels carrying them from the crypts of the Vale of Shadows through the numerous ruins of the North, including the decaying elven fortress of the Severed Hand and the lava-filled caverns of Dragon's Eye.  Much of their journey has been lost, but there is no doubt that their efforts led to the salvation of Kuldahar and the Ten-Towns and their deeds are still spoken of in Easthaven and Kuldahar to this day.  Hrothgar himself has been laid to rest in a small glen near the town of Kuldahar, in memory of his selflessness in coming to the aid of his neighbor in a time when Easthaven itself was suffering troubles of its own. 

Among their other acts of heroism, the adventurers are credited with the discovery of the location of the tomb of Kresselack the Black Wolf, one of the most infamous of the Northern generals, the discovery of the Severed Hand, and numerous other monasteries and ruins believed lost to time and the snows of the North. 

After reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell.  When a passage is recited from the book, it summons the howling winds of Icewind Dale to the reader's aid.

@595    = ~Wandering Sky~
@596    = ~The saga of Wandering Sky is a tale of hearth and home told by many skalds of the North.  The tale exemplifies the persistence and strength of the barbarian spirit.

When the legions of Arakon the Arch-Mage swept across Icewind Dale, the Tribe of the Bear was among the first of the tribes to meet his assault.  Overwhelmed by the superior forces, the barbarians fought bravely, but they were no match for Arakon's forces.  One of the tribe's eldest hunters and warriors, Hreidgar, was knocked unconscious during the battle, and he awoke to the sky tearing at his face and the remains of his fellows around him.  Of his wife and children, there was no trace, and without a word, Hreidgar took up his great sword and followed the path of Arakon's army, determined to reclaim them and avenge the fallen.  

Hreidgar was among the first to pledge his blade to the barbarian shaman Jerrod when he united the tribes against Arakon, and he served tirelessly in the great battles ahead, even on the darkest day when Arakon unleashed armies of the hells against Jerrod and the tribes.  In every battle, Hreidgar and his greatsword were as one, howling like the wind as he drove his enemies back... and to their deaths.  But when Arakon was at last defeated, no trace of Hreidgar's wife and child were to be found. 

Hreidgar continued his search, and his journey of many years is said to have taken him across the great cliffs of the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears, upon the Sea of Moving Ice where he sailed with the Tribe of the Great Whale and fought slavers from the south, and then to his final destination, the small town of Enholm's Point, where he stood with the handful of the town's defenders against the army of Kresselack the Black Wolf.  It is said Hreidgar fought so fiercely that Kresselack conceded the field in honor of the warrior - but not before striking the fatal blow that would end the warrior's life.

Bleeding from numerous wounds, Hreidgar is said to have wandered north from Enholm's Point, traveling for many miles before collapsing to his knees.  With the last of his strength, the old warrior plunged his blade into the ice and said he had finally found what he had been seeking.  "Let the sky wander," he proclaimed, "for my travels are done."

When the townsfolk of Enholm's Point returned the next day to carry his body away, they found Hreidgar, but his blade had vanished.  It is said that the blade now wanders as the sky wanders, finding its way to others with long journeys before them... and guiding them to their final destination, whatever it may be.

@599    = ~Milton Sixtoes' Armor of Absolute Self +2~
@600    = ~Absolute Self started out as very ordinary studded leather armor worn by an even more ordinary thief named Milton Sixtoes (so named since he had six toes on his left foot).  Milton belonged to a local thieves guild in the mining city of Mirabar, and thus was tasked with petty thievery of coin purses and the occasional gem.  

All was well enough by Milton's ordinary standards, until one day when a thief of notable magical prowess transferred to Milton's guild.  The guild master assigned this new thief to be Milton's partner in crime, aiding him in his petty, but profitable dirty deeds.  Little did Milton know that his new partner was not satisfied with petty thievery.  In fact, it was his partner's higher ambition that almost got Milton in trouble with the local authorities.  During thieving assignments with his new partner, Milton began to perform very risky acts of larceny, and not through his own will.  It was as if someone else had control of Milton's body and used him to carry out the acts.  Luckily for Milton, he was able to perform the higher risk activities, but he knew that one day his luck would run out.

So, one day when Milton was feeling more proactive than usual, he took the day off from thieving and ventured to a Dwarven armorsmith who resided in one of the upper Mirabar mining tunnels.  There, with his extra earnings from unwillingly performing his more dangerous thieving, he commissioned the dwarf to upgrade his studded leather and give it the power to ward off other's charms.  The dwarf complied and ended up upgrading Milton's ordinary studded leather into fine, extra tough studded leather that made the wearer immune to the spell Charm Person.

Not long after Milton began wearing the armor, he discovered his new partner was the one who cast the spell Charm Person on him and made him take all the extra risks.  The last time his partner tried to charm Milton, he (Milton) played along as if he were charmed, snuck up behind his partner, and slit his throat with an ordinary, poisoned dagger.  From then on, Milton was very pleased to go back to ordinary, petty thievery, though no more partners were ever assigned to Milton Sixtoes.

While in its death-throes, Frostmaw's jaws and icy breath took Kellem's left eye and ear - for this, the grim ranger swore vengeance on all its cursed ilk.  Upon his return to civilization, Kellem had Frostmaw's wide jaws fashioned into an elaborate helm and imbued with the white wyrm's deadly breath.  This helm the ranger christened "Wyrm's Maw."

Alas, in time Kellem grew old as all men do, and one day set out on a dangerous hunt in the peaks of the Spine of the World never to return.  Until now, none of his equipment has ever been found.

@612    = ~No one knows where this enchanted parrying dagger first came from, though it gained its fame in the service of the notorious corsair captain "Baron" Sulo of Luskan.  When Sulo and crew made to steal the Leberm family jewels from a small transport ship off the coast of Port Llast, they found themselves confronted by a group of experienced adventurers hired on as guards.  One in particular fought like a devil, wielding a matched set of finely wrought dueling blades.  The unnamed adventurer slew many of Sulo's men and, coming to clash with the corsair captain himself, severed Sulo's left hand.  "Baron" Sulo would have died that day were it not for a stray ballista round from the Leberm ship - the enormous spear struck the unlucky swordsman squarely and carried him over the side of Sulo's ship in a flash.  All that remained of him was his elaborate parrying blade, left spinning on the deck as if he'd never been there.

Sulo elected to graft the swordsman's parrying blade to the stump of his left wrist in the place of a common hook.  When Sulo was killed some nine years later, the blade was interned with him in a concealed tomb along with a substantial quantity of gems and coins.  Despite the "secret" nature of Sulo's final resting place, the site was quickly plundered and "Baron" Sulo's Hook passed into hands of other men.

@878    = ~This mighty weapon consists of a four  to five foot haft with a very heavy blade.  The axe may be double-bitted, with blades on both sides of the haft, or it may only have a single blade.  It is an unwieldy weapon, but a skilled warrior can strike blows of tremendous strength with it. Dwarven runes have been etched into the giant blade to further enhance the axe.

@879    = ~Delnar's Dart of Dispelling~
@880    = ~Delnar was a timid mage who never was one for adventure.  He spent most of his life in quiet study, living with his mother, trying to learn the art of crafting magical items.  For his first attempt, Delnar decided to create a dart that would be a mage's best friend.  The weapon would unerringly strike a target, dispel any magical protection, and then return to its user.

Unfortunately, just as he was placing the final enchantments on the item, Delnar's mother entered into the room, saw the dart, and said "Careful, ye'll put an eye out with that."  Much to his dismay, his mother's words became a part of the enchantment.  The dart did seem to work as intended, but occasionally would strike the user blind upon its return.

@883    = ~Sword of Gleaming Dykhast~
@884    = ~Ancient dwarven legends tell of a time when the noblest of metals was not dwarven steel, nor meteoric iron, nor mithril, but dykhast - an alloy so strong that a blade's edge would never dull with toil or battle, and with a surface so perfect and gleaming that its shimmering surface could be seen a dragon's flight away.  The oldest of dwarves speak of dykhast blades with tears of fond remembrance in their eyes, and callously spit at the mention of the "sundry weak and piddling'" metals that today's arms and armor are fashioned from.

There are rumors, though, of an ancient and secret temple called Chogoh Kyn - it is there, the tales say, that blades of dykhast are still made in the fashion of days long past.  The price may be high, but for the true connoisseur, there is no matching the glory, the perfection, the utter joy... of dykhast.

This particular weapon was apparantly created for use by some Talonite cleric, but was lost over the years.  It is now the personal weapon of the bugbear leader, Guthma... until you slew him, that is.
