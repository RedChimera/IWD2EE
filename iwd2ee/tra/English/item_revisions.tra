He held onto his prize catch, an "unbelievably massive" knucklehead trout, despite being charged by a hungry bear when he reached shore.

Ned walked the rest of the way to Targos and kept the head as evidence of his encounter. Over time, Ned started to attribute his good fortune as a sailor to his "lucky knucky". The brigand Marg the Trembler "won" Ned's lucky knucky away from him in a rigged card game. Ned was bitter over being cheated, but he wasn't willing to stand up to Marg to get it back.

@10173    = ~Few have heard of the (literally) short-lived underground movement against the Hosttower of the Arcane called the Circle of Ice - nor the rings that came to mark the members of the organization, both in life and in death. 

The Circle of Ice was sponsored by a merchant from Waterdeep whose name has been burned from recorded history by the Hosttower. Apparently, after being forced to debase himself before the Hosttower during a trading agreement in Luskan (and being forced to surrender much of his cargo), the merchant became obsessed with wiping the Hosttower from the face of Faerun. Commissioning wizards in Waterdeep to fashion a score of rings for him, he set about using the last of his remaining wealth to hire a band of wizard slayers to bring about the downfall of the Hosttower. These twenty wizard slayers made arrangements to travel north on their own and rendezvous with the merchant in Luskan. 

Ironically enough, the merchant never wore one of these rings, which was key in exposing and defeating the movement. As soon as he returned to Luskan, his mind was picked apart by telepaths and his movements scried, and each wizard slayer and accomplice was noted, identified, and ultimately led into deathtraps where their rings proved no match against the summoned monsters and arrows of slaying wielded by the ambush parties. It is rumored that only one wizard slayer, Martek, escaped the Hosttower, and to this day, he has never been found, which has been a constant source of irritation to the mages.

In any event, the Circle of Ice died a quick, silent death in Luskan, but the merchant lived on as a toy of the Hosttower, serving them until death, at which point, his corpse was stored in their laboratories. It is most likely his preserved body will end up as the left arm of a flesh golem named Bok many years from now. 

These small bands of Cold Reflection appear to be made of crystallized ice, very cold to the touch, and they cannot be seen by a wizard unless the wizard knows they are there. 

If your band contains one that fancies him or herself a wizard slayer, perhaps these rings may be used for the purpose they were intended... but without the shortsightedness of foolish merchants handicapping your efforts.

@10175    = ~During the formation of the Circle of Ice resistance movement against the wizards of the Hosttower of the Arcane, many special rings were forged for the wizard slayers of the organization to help them fend off the magical powers of their opponents. 

The organization and the forging of the rings was sponsored by a merchant from Waterdeep whose name has been burned from the annals of history by the Hosttower. Apparently, after being forced to debase himself before the Hosttower during a trading agreement in Luskan (and being forced to surrender much of his cargo), the merchant became obsessed with wiping the Hosttower from the face of Faerun. Commissioning wizards in Waterdeep to fashion a score of rings for him, he set about using the last of his remaining wealth to hire a band of wizard slayers to bring about the downfall of the Hosttower. These twenty wizard slayers made arrangements to travel north on their own and rendezvous with the merchant in Luskan. 

There was one wizard slayer named Martek, however, who ignored the rings offered by the merchant, and knowing the danger and guile of the Hosttower, instead commissioned a special ring from a dwarven ally that would provide him additional wards against spells and charms. Once the other members of the Circle of Ice began to be murdered in Luskan after the Hosttower learned their identities, Martek used the power of his enhanced ring to shield himself from the scrying of the Hosttower wizards and escape southwards. He eventually returned the ring to his dwarven ally, who sold it to a merchant making his way for Bryn Shander. 

This Cold Steel Reflection ring differs from the other Circle of Ice rings in that it seems to have a ring of steel beneath the icy exterior of the ring - much like Martek himself.

Apparently Prashnak was having a great deal of difficulty fending off a relentless scourge of trolls, who no doubt were interested in nothing more than his dug out, well stationed bower. Prashnak used storms of acid to keep the trolls at bay. However the young mage was tiring of the constant attacks, and the trolls were becoming bolder.

After several months of studying the various effects of wilting magic, elemental summoning, and magical methods of frosting, Prashnak was finally ready to try his experiment. After summoning a water elemental, Prashnak evaporated choice bodily components and then froze the hapless creature. This lead to the creation of truly horrific sculptures of ice. The trolls, as simple as they are, took extreme offense to these totems and reportedly fled the area. The experiment a gleaming success, the exultant Prashnak continues his woeful studies to this day. What manner of thief took hold of the bracers is unknown, but they have been missing for several years.

@10249    = ~In the surviving teachings of the Kamjin-Doh of Kara-Tur, it is written that a true weapon master relies not on leather, chain, or plate, but on honing their skills so that they are never struck at all... and this means a weapon master must know their enemy's movements like the movements of their own hand. But such mastery lies in staying focused upon your enemy even in the heat of battle... and these simple leather armbands are intended to do just that.

Initially used to help in the training of students at the Kamjin-Doh, these Bands of Focus radiate a soft moonlight glow when the light of dusk falls upon them. While worn, they exert a slight calming influence on the mind of the sword saint that wields them, heightening the warrior's perceptions and senses, and allowing them to read the movements of their opponents easier. On the rare occasion when an enemy strikes a sword saint, these bands allow the wielder to shrug off pain (which in the teachings of Kamjin-Doh are called, "distractions") and keep the pain where it belongs - on one's opponent. 

Many of these bands were scattered throughout Faerun in the wake of the destruction of the Kamjin-Doh at the hands of the Master of Razors. It is rumored that the Master of Razors possessed a set of these bands as well, but their location remains a mystery.

The identities of those who defeated him are not known, but the rumors in Kara Tur were that his slayers were the spirits of three sword saints of Kamjin-Doh, returned from death to end the crimes of the renegade kensei.

It was discovered that these once-simple bands of focus that the Master of Razors had worn as a student had become stained with blood and shame, and no longer shone with the same light as it once had. As the Master lost focus, his bands of focus corroded, almost to rot away as they were wrapped upon his bleeding arms. Nonetheless, these tattered bands still hold the power, strength, and viciousness of the Master of Razors... making the one who wields them far more deadly.

If you wear these bands, never forget their purpose, never forget your focus, and never forget the reach of your enemy. Keep these three things in your heart, and they will serve you well in battle.

Investigation reveals that this belt was made four hundred years ago for Factor Dom, a warden for the outer-planar Mercykillers faction.

Dom was a warden of the Prison, Sigil's dumping ground for criminals. He became legendary within the organization after his involvement in the Great Break. Members of the rebellious Free League engineered the only mass escape from the Prison in its history. Over one hundred prisoners managed to get out of the Prison and escape the Lady's Ward, though hundreds more were turned back to their cells or died in their escape.

Described as a dark-skinned man with burning eyes and bloodied chains hanging from his wrists, the stories that circle the Black Raven frequently tell of his epic struggles against slavers and injustice throughout the North and the southern kingdoms.  Some historians speculate that the Black Raven may have been a drow or half-drow, but others claim that he was a minor or quasi-deity dedicated to ending slavery and oppression.

This black sash is made of fine silk, perhaps spider silk, and it is worn looped around the waist.  While worn, it helps the wearer focus in combat, freeing his mind of all distractions and channeling his inner energies to defeat his foes.  When worn by any class other than a monk, it immediately unknots itself and falls to the ground.

@10329    = ~On the farms in the Dalelands west of the Moonsea, most of the men and women who work the fields lead simple, humble lives. It is out of one such simple life that the legend of Behem Farmer of Mistledale emerged. However, the circumstances surrounding his legend are far from typical. While tending his farm near Sword Creek, bandit riders from the east rode forth and told him to surrender his land. Behem was overcome with grief and could not answer them. The leader of the bandits told Behem that he had until dawn of the next morning to vacate the land. The bandits then rode towards other farms and told them the same thing. At dusk, as the farmers cleared out their homes and prepared to fall back to defensible ground, some of the families saw the silhouette of Behem standing in his field, leaning upon his hoe, his head hung low.

In the evening, three farmers approached Behem's field and saw the farmer asleep in his field. More shocking was the apparition of a woman, believed to be the spirit of Chauntea, wrapping Behem's loose cloak around him. The farmers returned to their families and told everyone what they had witnessed. Bolstered by the belief that Chauntea had blessed Behem for staying on his farm, the farmers gathered up their families and marched back to their farms. Unfortunately, their bravery had returned a few moments too late. Behem had just been killed by the bandits for refusing to leave. Before the eyes of the farmers, thick vines erupted from the field the bandits stood upon. The vegetation not only held the bandits firmly in place, but also thrashed and choked them into unconsciousness. The farmers rushed forward and drove off the bandits who remained. Though Behem's body disappeared with the vines, his bloodstained, tattered cloak remained behind.

But if by chance a talented fighter, or a skilled bowman connected with their weapon, the wizard would not have the fortitude to last long.

Clerics of Mystra, seeing this dilemma that fell upon the wizards of the land, made cloaks blessed by Mystra herself. These cloaks granted the wizard special damage resistances where most, if not all, the damage that was dealt out from a weapon would be negated. In addition, the clerics of Mystra empowered the cloaks with the ability to cast Stoneskin. Needless to say that wizards who acquired the cloaks, which eventually were called Mystra's Embrace, felt even more powerful, if not invulnerable.

They are devoted to fighting those who defile nature, and these cloaks were sometimes worn by members of their sect when embarking on their crusades against those who had inflicted grievous wounds upon the land. It is reported that several of these cloaks were worn by druids who followed the trail of the Dark Horde many long years ago during their attack on the elven fortress of the Severed Hand. The Horde had felled many trees and laid waste to vast sections of the North while building siege engines, and the avengers declared war on them, attempting to use turn the power of nature against its attackers. Although the avengers were eventually slain by an orcish clan along the Spine of the World, their cloaks remain and occasionally resurface across the North. 

When worn by a druid, these cloaks have a chance of calling bright fire any enemy who dares to commit violence upon the wearer. It has blinded many a foe... only to have them die with an avenger's blade in their throat.

It is said that a wind tore through Arundel's home after the events twenty years past and hurled his cloak into the upper branches of the Kuldahar Oak, where it was lashed and beaten by the icy winds for days, and ultimately lifted up and carried upon the storms for nearly a month. When it settled down, it was taken up by a wandering druid, who wore the cloak and used it to crush a sect of Aurilites in the ice shadowed delves of Slow Cedric's Gallop three years ago. Once his task was accomplished, the cloak was taken up by the wind again, and carried northward to be used against those that threaten the Balance once again. 

It is intended to avenge those who disrupt the Balance with violence, and to remind aggressors that one may not defeat nature, only anger it.

@10378    = ~Aeryl Goldenbeard was a particularly flamboyant pirate that sailed the seas off the coast of Amn. He was the captain of the pirate warship, The Bouncing Rhonda; a twenty gun cutter that was considered one of the fastest vessels on the high seas. Those unfortunate merchant ships that crossed paths with The Bouncing Rhonda were never able to outrun the cutter, were summarily boarded and their merchandise stolen. 

Now, the fact that Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard and his hearty men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully pirated ships was not so unusual. No, the unusual part was that after the men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully seized a merchant vessel, Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard would jump from the crow's nest, grab a rope in mid flight that was tied to the mast, gallantly swing down and land elegantly upon the deck of the merchant ship. At almost the same time Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard's feet touched the merchant ship's deck, the captured crew took an instant liking to the pirate captain. In fact, it was not uncommon for a majority of the captured crews to beg for a commission on The Bouncing Rhonda. However, the instant the pirate captain and his crew left the merchant ship (along with its cargo), the remaining merchant ship's crew immediately resumed their hatred for the pirate captain.

No one knew why or how Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard managed to charm his victims so well. That is, not until one day, while the good pirate captain was making one of his famous entrances via rope and mast, his colorful bandana flew off his near balding head. The second his foot touched the deck, all the former merchant crews that went along with the pirate ship instantly came to their senses and summarily beat the pirate captain to death. It did not take long for those around to realize that the pirate captain's bandana held magical properties that made him seem more charming. 

Unfortunately for the remaining pirate and merchant crew, the bandana flew into the sea. However, rumors would pop up from time to time that a particularly dashing swashbuckler had the uncanny ability to charm his way out of trouble and liked to swing from mast ropes - and that he wore a very colorful bandana.

@10467    = ~Milton Sixtoes' Armor +2~
@10468    = ~Milton Sixtoes' Armor started out as very ordinary studded leather armor worn by an even more ordinary thief named Milton Sixtoes (so named since he had six toes on his left foot). Milton belonged to a local thieves guild in the mining city of Mirabar, and thus was tasked with petty thievery of coin purses and the occasional gem.

All was well enough by Milton's ordinary standards, until one day when a thief of notable magical prowess transferred to Milton's guild. The guild master assigned this new thief to be Milton's partner in crime, aiding him in his petty, but profitable dirty deeds. Little did Milton know that his new partner was not satisfied with petty thievery. In fact, it was his partner's higher ambition that almost got Milton in trouble with the local authorities. During thieving assignments with his new partner, Milton began to perform very risky acts of larceny, and not through his own will. It was as if someone else had control of Milton's body and used him to carry out the acts. Luckily for Milton, he was able to perform the higher risk activities, but he knew that one day his luck would run out.

So, one day when Milton was feeling more proactive than usual, he took the day off from thieving and ventured to a Dwarven armorsmith who resided in one of the upper Mirabar mining tunnels. There, with his extra earnings from unwillingly performing his more dangerous thieving, he commissioned the dwarf to upgrade his studded leather and give it the power to ward off other's charms. The dwarf complied and ended up upgrading Milton's ordinary studded leather into fine, extra tough studded leather that made the wearer immune to the spell Charm Person.

Not long after Milton began wearing the armor, he discovered his new partner was the one who cast the spell Charm Person on him and made him take all the extra risks. The last time his partner tried to charm Milton, he (Milton) played along as if he were charmed, snuck up behind his partner, and slit his throat with an ordinary, poisoned dagger. From then on, Milton was very pleased to go back to ordinary, petty thievery, though no more partners were ever assigned to Milton Sixtoes.

Soon afterwards, she went to a cleric of Sune and had the cursed armor removed, never to be used again by the wild elf ranger.

@10476    = ~One of the greatest skills a scout can have is the ability to sneak about undetected. For many years a scout will hone their craft in the arts of hiding in shadows and moving silently, just so they may attain one of the most valuable resources in the realm - information. 

While a skilled scout may be able to slink undetected around a camp of regular soldiers and bandits with ease, the same cannot be said if the camp the scout is observing is protected by detection magics. It is because of this very reason that the armor known as Interloper was created.

Many generations ago, skilled wood elf craftsman perfected a technique that was able to combine powerful non-detection magic into leather armor. Using this armor, wood elf scouts could infiltrate even the most well protected campsites without fear of being discovered by any magical means. Unfortunately, one of the scouts grew careless and was captured as he was spying on a drow raiding party. After days of torturing their prisoner, the drow were able to learn how the scouts were able to infiltrate their camps and even the location of the village at which these special armors were being made. Needless to say, every man, woman and child in that village was ruthlessly slaughtered...except one. This particular Interloper armor managed to survive only because the individual who wore it was away from the wood elf community the day the drow attacked.

Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep. After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic. He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit's creation. Following his master's instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail. He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours. When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate. Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years. His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

This armor was worn by a mercenary company called the Silver Band who was driven from the north after a heated debate at the Ten-Towns council (a debate that barred further mercenary service from most of the Ten-Towns for a period not exceeding three seasons). According to the debate, the mercenaries were not seen as effective combatants, and certainly not worth the gold they were paid for their meager weapon skills.

In order to pay for their passage back south, the Silver Band was forced to sell several suits of their armor in order to transport their mounts and siege engines, and the Band swore they would never return to the North, even if the region perished under an avalanche of goblins and other freakish monsters. Apparently, their ability to predict the future was not listed in their company annals. 

This armor is valued in the far north due to its ability to protect the wielder from the elements as well as being light enough to allow for greater freedom of movement.

@10534    = ~Maya Selvinis was a solitary half-elf ranger who lived on the outskirts of Neverwinter. Feeling different and un-whole due to her breeding, she rarely had any interaction with other people except when she was summoned to aid in a crisis. Although she did not care for the company of others, she was more than eager to aid those in peril. However, after helping others, she would quickly return to her solitary ways, despite the general tolerance exhibited by the locals in Neverwinter.

One special event that called for her ranger skills came and changed her life forever. An elderly female cleric of Eilistraee came to Maya and asked her aid in tracking down and destroying a demon that was tormenting her flock. Maya eagerly accepted the quest, put on her splint mail armor, secured her sword, and followed the cleric through the woods. After a day's travel, the cleric stopped at a small clearing between four towering trees. In the middle of the clearing was a small pond of water no wider than a yard. The cleric turned to Maya and said that the demon could be seen in the pond. Doubting, Maya approached the pond and peered in. The only thing Maya saw was her own reflection, and she stated that fact rather tersely to the cleric. The cleric smirked a bit and replied by saying that the demon was her reflection. In fact, the cleric pointed out that the demon was responsible for Maya's solitude and self-pity, and that the only one who was concerned about Maya's mixed breeding was Maya.

Maya scoffed at the cleric, told her that she did not know what she was talking about, turned and started to head back in the direction they came. The cleric shouted back, which startled Maya, and declared that she understood more than Maya could ever know. It was at that point that the elderly cleric revealed herself to be Maya's mother. Maya again scoffed, stating that her mother died long ago. The cleric bowed her head and replied that yes, she did die, but that she was granted the grace of Eilistaee to seek out Maya and aid her - aid her in destroying the demon of self-pity and solitude. The cleric then went on to say that Maya would never find sanctuary by alienating herself from the company of others, but that sanctuary comes from within. Once Maya could accept who she was, what she was, and the fact that there were many out in the world like her and who were willing to embrace her, then sanctuary would follow her, always. Then, in a brief flash of light, the cleric was gone, leaving Maya to stew with the wisdom of the old cleric - her mother.

Maya thought on what her mother said, and soon tried to implement her mother's wisdom. After a few months, Maya found her inner sanctuary, and became more powerful because of it. In fact, that power was also absorbed by her splint mail armor. All those who donned Maya's splint mail felt a peace flow through their being. People found their own personal sanctuary within that armor, which soon became known as Sanctity.

@10538    = ~A talented, gnome smith, who went by the name of Boopie Silvermallet, made this armor to the exacting specifications of a half-orc barbarian named Tuqak Mauler. Forged from the finest metals and enchanted with Boopie's secret recipe magics, Tuqak's new armor looked more like a museum showpiece rather than practical combat armor. The steel strips shone with a silver brilliance and each rivet sparkled like fresh cut diamonds. When Tuqak put the armor on, he immediately felt more vigorous and alive. Unfortunately for Tuqak, this new armor also made him overconfident, which summarily caused his demise in a later battle. 

So, wearer be warned - even though you feel like you can take on the world while wearing Tuqak's armor, you will still have to rely on combat skill to carry you through... alive.

@10540    = ~A talented, gnome smith, who went by the name of Boopie Silvermallet, made this armor to the exacting specifications of a half-orc barbarian named Tuqak Mauler. Forged from the finest metals and enchanted with Boopie's secret recipe magics, Tuqak's new armor looked more like a museum showpiece rather than practical combat armor. The steel strips shone with a silver brilliance and each rivet sparkled like fresh cut diamonds. When Tuqak put the armor on, he immediately felt more vigorous and alive. Unfortunately for Tuqak, this new armor also made him overconfident, which summarily caused his demise in a later battle. 

So, wearer be warned - even though you feel like you can take on the world while wearing Tuqak's armor, you will still have to rely on combat skill to carry you through... alive.

One look at the armor and it is simple to see that it possesses powerful protections.

Long ago, the Blood War between the Baazetu and the Tanar'ri spilled over to the material plane. Luckily for most of the world, the battle was far away from any major towns or cities. However, this was still no comfort for the Celestial beings that watched over the material plane. So, it was quickly decided to amass as many Celestial and Aasimar beings as possible and drive the Blood War back into its own abyssal planes. However, because of the great numbers of Tanar'ri and Baatezu, the Celestial beings permanently blessed all the Aasimars' armor with Protection from Evil. This spell allowed the Aasimars to get in close to the evil creatures without getting attacked. Once all the Aasimars were in position, the Celestials gave the order to attack, which completely surprised the hordes of Baazetu and Tanar'ri. The ensuing battle raged for days, with high casualties on both sides, but eventually the evil hordes were pushed back into their abyssal planes.

It was during one of his foraging expeditions that he surprised a group of dwarven miners of the Brueghor Clan who were new to the region. Before Gohji could raise his hands to show he meant them no harm, an enchanted warhammer shattered his knee, causing him to plummet to the ground. When the dwarves advanced to finish him off, they were brought up short by the giant's tears and they found they could not bear to kill their now-helpless foe. They brought a healer to mend his wounds, and then took Gohji (now dubbed the "Sad Giant") back to his cave. Over the next several weeks, the dwarves brought him food and forged a magical cap for his knee to help him walk again - they called it the "Sad Giant's Cap," and the friendship between the Brueghor Clan and Gohji was mortared in history. 

Gohji and many of the Brueghor Clan were eventually slain during an invasion of gnolls and ogres into the Sunset Mountains, and the Sad Giant's Cap was pried from his bloody body by the gnolls of the Burning Eye Clan.

Forged of dull black steel, the blade is engraved in the fashion of a barbed tongue while the handle is textured with minute scales. Because the enchanted dagger whips back to the thrower's hand once it has struck a solid object, its barbs can do horrendous damage to a target.

In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

The short sword's dark magic not only protects the wielder from the effects of magical webs, but can entangle a target with webs of its own as well.

An assassin typically uses the weapon to seal a target in a cocoon of silk, stepping away from their thrashing foe to complete the murder with a poisoned dart or wrist-crossbow bolt. Such weapons have also helped many a would-be assassin flee from something that they've backstabbed but failed to kill with a single blow.

He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun. It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

//@10893    = ~"Cera Sumat," Holy Avenger~
@10894    = ~The holy avenger is the paladin's ultimate weapon against the forces of evil. There are few creatures on the Lower Planes that would not hesitate to confront a holy warrior wielding such a weapon... and this one, perhaps more so than others. Once, it was nothing more than a simple iron sword, but through the courage and faith of one man, it became something more.

The blade of this holy avenger glows with a soft golden light. Inscribed upon the hilt in flowing gold letters is "Cera Sumat," which translates into "Six, now Silenced."  Cera Sumat earned its name through the labors of elderly duke Kholsa Ehld, a man cresting nearly eighty years of age, who vowed to complete a task that the greatest warriors of three kingdoms feared to do... all because of the weeping of a child. 

The times in which Old Duke Ehld lived were ones of great upheaval, and the servitors of Bane were strong, crushing all that stood in their way. Entire kingdoms feared their wrath, and to speak out against them meant death, so many remained silent and turned their eyes from the evils of Bane and his servants. 

During these dark times, the most terrible of Bane's minions were six who called themselves the Lost Followers. Their souls were storms of avarice and hate, and mighty were the powers at their command. They reveled in strife and tyranny... and for all the blood they shed, it was never enough. 

Together, the Lost Followers brought about the downfall of the Silver Court, slaying its king upon his throne and renaming his once-beautiful nation the Barbed Kingdom. After animating his decapitated corpse and having it march through the streets slaying anyone it could find, they brought a rain of fire down upon the city and the lands around, leaving it a barren wasteland. It is said that they dined in the capital's great hall that night as the land burned, and they raised their wine glasses as the screams of the dying reached their peak. 

There was only one survivor. In their last act of malice, the Lost Followers left the king's only daughter, barely five years old, alive to reign as "Queen" over the burned kingdom. They called her the Weeping Queen and cast wards about her so that she might never leave the empty capital, and then left her to starve. Their appetite momentarily slaked, the Lost Followers parted ways and went upon their separate roads of damnation, sowing strife in the Bane's Name.

Old Duke Ehld was the first one to cross the wards of the Barbed Kingdom and seek out the Weeping Queen upon her father's throne. When he found the small girl, he approached, kneeled before her, and told her he had come to pledge his life in her service. In stiff, formal words, he said he had brought food and water and apologized for his lateness, but his bones were old and it had taken him some time to reach this place. The near-starving child stared at him as he pledged his worn blade and his honor to seeing that the ones who had done this terrible crime answered for their actions, if his Queen wished it. After a long, stunned silence, the Weeping Queen found the words to thank him.

From the moment Ehld left the throne room in search of the Lost Followers, the weeping of the queen ended, and she never wept again. 

Over six years, Ehld traveled the lands of Faerun and across the planes themselves, seeking the Six, and asking them to answer for their crimes. Each scoffed at the old man and his worn-looking blade, only to find him a dangerous opponent... and in the end, the victor. He recorded the events of their death upon a stone set into the pommel of his blade, and there was even regret in his writings that he had not been able to enlighten the Lost Followers to turn from their path before it came to its end.

When the last of the Six had answered for their crimes upon the edge of the Cera Sumat blade, Ehld returned to the Weeping Queen and laid the blade at her feet. Where once it had been a tarnished blade, it shone as brightly as the sun, and the stone in the pommel was covered with the writing of his journeys. He detached the stone, and set into a chain, and he gave it to the Weeping Queen. Ehld told her to keep the chain to wear as a reminder of the many evils of the world and that they are never far from one's heart... but if one's heart is true and one's path is righteous, one may triumph against any number of evils.

Duke Ehld outlived his queen, living to the age of 107, at which point Ehld took his Cera Sumat and left the Barbed Kingdom... and is said to have traveled north. In time, the Barbed Kingdom rose to its former glory and its name was changed, and with it, the fate of Cera Sumat and the Medallion of the Lost Followers was forgotten... until your arrival in Kuldahar and the medallion and the Holy Avenger were united once again to meet the Lost Followers in battle one final time. 

But the story of Ehld and Cera Sumat was a story of another time, and of the adventures of another hero. This is now your time, and your epic. If your band counts a paladin among its number, then this ancient blade is yours to wield against the forces of evil... 

And perhaps, if your heart is true, save a land from destruction once again.

Upon the blade was inscribed "Know thy family," and Thomas took the motto to heart. Bolstered by the sword and his mother's loss, he became determined to find Kresselack - whether out of a need for a new family to belong to or to take revenge on Kresselack for abandoning his mother, it is not known. 

When he found the Black Wolf, Kresselack spurned the young man, claiming that the sickly and weak-looking Thomas shared no blood with him, then ordered him beaten and left beneath the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn to die. After two days in the freezing cold, Thomas was rescued by a tribe of Uthgart barbarians fleeing Kresselack's army. Nursing the man back to health, the barbarians adopted Thomas into their tribe and he eventually became one of their greatest hunters. When he passed away from winter chill many years later, he left his sword to his youngest son to help him find his way in the world.

There, alone in the cavernous chamber, were Wroth, Hateful, and Furious - the dread sword, axe, and armor of Hurom, ancient ancestor of Alemis, once known as the Bloody Juggernaut before he broke his cursed iron's spell and took the Peacemaker name."

"Alemis, a mere boy, donned the fell armor and took Wroth and Hateful in hand. Alone he cut his way through Borab's motley horde of humanoid raiders until he faced the towering half-giant himself, hacking him down and scattering his army to the wind. His family - father, mother, brothers and sisters alike - had all died by then, but Alemis no longer cared. He stalked the realms, eyes ablaze with madness, slaying monsters and brigands wherever he found them. But as the years passed and Alemis found no more of such wheat to thresh, he took to turning his thirsting blades on all who crossed his path... and so, once more, the Bloody Juggernaut had returned."

  -- from "Master Pelib's Bedtime Tales"

This heavy, unadorned bastard sword of dull gray steel is a cursed thing, only showing its true form when the wielder is wounded in battle. It is then that the hilt sprouts crimson tendrils that bury themselves in the wielder's forearm; drinking his or her blood, the demon-sword opens the three glaring eyes along its twisting, dripping blade and drives the wielder mad with lust for bloodshed.

Should a warrior carry Wroth along with its brothers Hateful and Furious, his or her soul would be lost to the hell-forged arms and armor. To wield even Wroth alone might be construed as insanity... but there will always be those for whom it may be just the weapon they're looking for.

Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of greatswords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.

@11020    = ~The saga of Wandering Sky is a tale of hearth and home told by many skalds of the North. The tale exemplifies the persistence and strength of the barbarian spirit.

When the legions of Arakon the Arch-Mage swept across Icewind Dale, the Tribe of the Bear was among the first of the tribes to meet his assault. Overwhelmed by the superior forces, the barbarians fought bravely, but they were no match for Arakon's forces. One of the tribe's eldest hunters and warriors, Hreidgar, was knocked unconscious during the battle, and he awoke to the sky tearing at his face and the remains of his fellows around him. Of his wife and children, there was no trace, and without a word, Hreidgar took up his great sword and followed the path of Arakon's army, determined to reclaim them and avenge the fallen. 

Hreidgar was among the first to pledge his blade to the barbarian shaman Jerrod when he united the tribes against Arakon, and he served tirelessly in the great battles ahead, even on the darkest day when Arakon unleashed armies of the hells against Jerrod and the tribes. In every battle, Hreidgar and his greatsword were as one, howling like the wind as he drove his enemies back... and to their deaths. But when Arakon was at last defeated, no trace of Hreidgar's wife and child were to be found. 

Hreidgar continued his search, and his journey of many years is said to have taken him across the great cliffs of the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears, upon the Sea of Moving Ice where he sailed with the Tribe of the Great Whale and fought slavers from the south, and then to his final destination, the small town of Enholm's Point, where he stood with the handful of the town's defenders against the army of Kresselack the Black Wolf. It is said Hreidgar fought so fiercely that Kresselack conceded the field in honor of the warrior - but not before striking the fatal blow that would end the warrior's life.

Bleeding from numerous wounds, Hreidgar is said to have wandered north from Enholm's Point, traveling for many miles before collapsing to his knees. With the last of his strength, the old warrior plunged his blade into the ice and said he had finally found what he had been seeking. "Let the sky wander," he proclaimed, "for my travels are done."  

When the townsfolk of Enholm's Point returned the next day to carry his body away, they found Hreidgar, but his blade had vanished. It is said that the blade now wanders as the sky wanders, finding its way to others with long journeys before them... and guiding them to their final destination, whatever it may be.

Little is known about the origins of this weapon, but it is rumored to have been passed down from generation to generation by human Mulhorandi woman.  According to legend, whenever these women gave birth to a girl while being forced into slavery, they would, on the night of the first full moon, pray to the ancient pharaoh Tyrish for guidance.  Hearing their prayers, Tyrish would send "floating down from the heavens" this sword, and the woman would use it to severely disfigure their children.  Once the deed was done, the sword would float away as gracefully as it had arrived.  These children, now deemed undesirable by their slavers, would be sold for a quick profit, thus sparing them the horrors of slavery.

All manner of bandits, murderers, rapists, and other worthies were left dangling from its knotty limbs; and all to the delight of the grave-digger Mordigan. For Mordigan, a secret practitioner of the necromantic arts, saw ample opportunity in which to ply his trade. Interring the remains of the evil men within close proximity of the tree, Mordigan called upon the dark powers of the negative material to perform a baleful act upon the black willow. It was given a sort of semi-sentience, and the ability to feed upon the remains of those who had so recently swung from its branches. Black roots descended into rotting flesh; and alarmingly enough, the tortured visages of the slain began to appear in the twisted knots of the black willow's bole before its burning. But, to the surprise of the villagers, the potently ensorcelled staff carved by the hands of the evil Mordigan did indeed prove to be their undoing. And thus did the hanged men of Dead Man's Tree have their revenge.

Most of its hollowed length consists of a series of compartments holding poisonous powders, spring-loaded darts, weighted chains, jutting spikes, entangling hooks, and various other concealed weapons. When used in combat there is always a chance that one or more of the staff's nasty little "tricks" will be sprung upon an unwary opponent. However, great care must be taken in its use - the weapon can easily harm the casual wielder.

Ryomaru himself carried the staff on only three missions, eventually leaving it in the care of the Hojori Temple - a Kumo clan front - and moving on to even more cunning and dangerous weapons. When the renowned thief "Chicken" Wu Wei - so named for the falcon tattoo on his chest - burglarized the temple, the Kumo were quick to uncover his involvement and track him back to his homeland in Shou Lung. Wu Wei was forced to flee across the sea to escape their wrath, prompting the dispatch of three more bands of Kumo assassins: one to cross the Eastern Ocean to find Wu Wei, a second to slay the original group that had failed to catch him in Shou Lung, and a third to torture and then execute Wu Wei's every living relative.

"Chicken" Wu Wei retired comfortably on the coast of the Western Heartlands, running a small tobacco shop and only occasionally thinking of his father in Shou Lung, a gambling drunkard who'd beaten Wu Wei's mother and only sister to death when he was a child. When the Kumo assassins at last caught up with Wu Wei, there was naught but a tombstone - the Daring Chicken had sold every last bit of stolen Kumo treasure and died a happy old man.

His tribe's battles against hordes of orcs, goblins, and hill giants are legendary throughout the north. Unfortunately for Pergad, the other tribes of the region decided to move south or settle in the cities of the north rather than fight against the seemingly endless waves of foes. Pergad's tribe, the Tribe of Dead Trees, was the last to make a stand. Though Pergad emerged victorious in a series of difficult battles, his tribe dwindled as quickly as the horde grew. At the Battle of Surbrin Shallows in 1014 DR, Pergad's tribe finally came to its end under cruel ogre clubs and giant-hurled rocks. Legend states that when Pergad finally realized that his tribe was doomed, he drove his trusted spear into the Surbrin riverbed, cursing all the goblins who crossed over the water that his people once thrived on. Orcish shamans claim that the spot where his spear penetrated the rock bled for days. A year later, two tribes of goblins were wiped out by a plague that spread among them after they settled in the Surbrin river valley.

"Oh," he had then added, "and pray thee bless it as well... thou dost know, that one where it explodes undead and what-not, so that I might smite things most explosively."

Lodur's fierce demeanor, violent reputation, and sacks of gold begged quiet compliance, and so the dwarven arms-master simply nodded and sent the cleric on his way, promising the weapon in two months' time. The arm-master consulted with his clan's lore-master and sure enough, there *was* word of such a weapon: it came from a trader in Sigil by way of an exceptionally well-traveled plane-walker. The arms-master dutifully copied the weapon's function and form, working runes of power into its haft and head just as Lodur had asked for.

For many years this long forgotten weapon hung upon the walls of Clan Ironsmelt, until one fateful day a horde of goblins invaded. In the final moments of the battle, a lone injured dwarf grabbed Cloudkiss in desperation from its purchase and flung it at the approaching horde. To his surprise, Cloudkiss transformed into a lightning bolt and surged thru the throngs of goblins with deadly accuracy. As fast as he could throw the axe it would return, leaving smoldering corpses wherever it traveled. By any rights this should have been a tale of legend, but with any legend there has to be survivors to tell the tale. Unfortunately, Clan Ironsmelt died that day along with that unnamed dwarf.

Dullcobble, realizing he had to back his proud words, agreed heartily... but inside, he was struck with fear that he would fail the test.

Dullcobble made several attempts to fashion a chopping axe, most of them ending up as cordwood next to his fireplace. In the day before his challenge was to be called due, his only surviving weapon was a lop-sided axe whose haft was widely overbalanced. Realizing that displaying such a weapon would make him the laughing stock of the community, Dullcobble hired a wild mage to take his misshapen axe and turn it into a serviceable weapon. The mage shrugged, took his payment, and promised the axe to Dullcobble on the dawn of the next day. When Dullcobble woke up in the morning, the misshapen axe lay on his doorstep, unchanged, and he had no choice but to take the axe to his challengers... and take his chances. 

When Dullcobble brought it into the town's meeting hall, the axe's appearance was greeted with derision and laughter. Dullcobble, his face burning, became so angry he threw it at his tormenters - and watched as the haft traveled over the blade's head to smash into a pillar and shatter it, causing the roof to collapse. Dullcobble, slack-jawed with surprise, was knocked unconscious by a falling timber, but the other challengers made it outside without injury.

Dullcobble's blow to the head was a serious one, and it turned him into the village idiot - not much of a change from his previous lifestyle. The axe itself was tossed upon a merchant cart headed north, and it was never seen again. Whatever the enchantments the wild mage scrawled on the axe did, it causes the haft to be the first to strike an opponent, doing crushing damage instead of slashing damage.

@11331    = ~Big Death +1~
@11332    = ~The gargantuan throwing axe known as Big Death is an orcish weapon through and through. Carried to the final battle of the Hand of Seldarine by the hulking orc warlord Yellow-Toothed Grubrun Foul-Tusks, Big Death had its origins in an ogre mercenary's two-handed battle-axe. After a particular vicious raid on a dwarven mining settlement, Grubrun spied the axe lodged in the skull of a dead dwarven marshal. It seems that an ogre mercenary had impaled himself upon the marshal's spear in a careless charge, but his last act had been to nearly cleave his killer's head in twain and, in trying to wrench the axe free for a second blow, shattering the haft before expiring in a bloody heap.

Prying the huge, black cold-iron blade from the base of the dwarf's skull, Grubrun returned to his fortress at Nab-Nurog and had his shaman set to enchanting it. Not having considered fixing the shaft and finding it too heavy and awkward to use in melee, Grubrun deigned to use the weapon as a throwing axe and demanded that it be ensorcelled to return to his hands after being hurled. The warlord found great delight in heaving the enormous weapon about, roaring with glee as Big Death came careening back to him, gleaming and gore-spattered, after lopping some poor enemy in two at the waist.

Grubrun Foul-Tusks finally met his end at the final battle of the Hand where he threw Big Death at the elven weapon master Kaylessa; she deftly sidestepped the flying weapon, darted forward, and ran her own blade through the empty-handed orc's belly. Kaylessa was said to have then coolly ducked as Grubrun's own axe came whirling back at him and cleanly severed his head, rotten yellow tusks and all.

Big Death is an especially large axe - almost ridiculously so - and is only identifiable as a throwing weapon because its short haft and the manner in which it's weighted. In fact, the axe is so massive that it cannot be thrown with a single hand, requiring the wielder to grip it with both hands and hurl it sidelong with the strength of their entire body.

This greataxe was the only possession of the town executioner, who was reported to never let the blade leave his side, giving it the name of the "Tale of the Executioner's Wife."  As the years passed, however, the town executioner eventually found a willing mistress in one of the town's brothels who seemed untroubled by his profession, and he paid her numerous visits over the following months. When the town authorities came to arrest the harlot (who was actually an accomplished thief) for thefts within the city walls, they found the city executioner in her bed and the woman nowhere to be found. The executioner was implicated in her escape, and his own axe was used to behead him in the town square. The execution had a record turnout, and many agreed that the "executioner's wife" had had her final say on his adultery.

Shavauntea was quite surprised to find that the weapon had the opposite effect when she brought it down upon her husband's unsuspecting head. The club was thought to have been destroyed in the battle between the two lovers after Grothak regained his senses. Obviously, this was not the case.

For many, the tree represents a peaceful symbiosis between town and nature, and the tree is revered as a holy site by druids throughout Faerun.

When the town of Kuldahar was laid siege by the great evil from the Spine of the World Mountains in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR, the great tree of Kuldahar was buffeted by the great winds and howling storms blasting the region, causing its circle of warmth to recede and snapping off several limbs from the top of the tree. These limbs were gathered up by the town's residents after the town of Kuldahar was saved, and they were kept in many houses as a symbol of the town's persistence in the face of adversity. Some of these pieces of the great tree have found their way throughout the Ten-Towns, and the limbs still carry some of the warmth and enchantment of the great tree within them, making them powerful weapons.

@11396    = ~Belib the Wary was arguably the best-equipped adventurer the realms had ever known - or would have been, had he ever actually left his home on one. Just one item from his astounding list of enchanted dungeoneering equipment is his Everlasting Torch. A magical lantern fashioned in the shape of an elaborate wooden torch, the item burns with a bright orange flame that cannot be extinguished - whether dunked in water, buried under several feet of rock, or smashed over the head of a soggy marsh-troll, Belib's Everlasting Torch simply will not be put out.

When Belib finally finished the last of his items, he crammed them all into a giant pack - enchanted to hold far more than Belib could normally carry himself, of course - and heaved it onto his shoulders, prepared for the adventure of a lifetime. As Belib crossed the threshold of his dwelling he tripped... and the tiny gnome was instantly crushed beneath his enormous backpack. The bag burst open, its contents scattering across the Waterdeep street where Belib had lived and rapidly vanishing into the hands of various good-for-nothing passersby.

Belib's corpse was eventually taken to a temple and raised by a kind-hearted priestess, but by then the last of Belib's enchanted items... and most of the contents of his home... were long gone. Grateful but understandably upset, Belib fashioned a number of unique magical items for the priestess before returning to his family and homeland, forever vanishing from the surface world.

Once someone is smacked with the paw, aside from the considerable damage, there is a chance that the recipient of the discipline will suffer from heightened fear and/or confusion.

During a battle in the northern wastes which became known as Hallowed Pass, Wychgar lost his three brothers to the orc army led by Kraag the Mighty. Wychgar was distraught and during the night he wandered the battlefield looking for their bodies to take away for proper burial. He stumbled across them and was visited by the brothers' spirits who were trapped between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Unable to help them leave he had their souls stored in the flail with the help of a shaman.

The three heads of the flail are his brother's skulls, which are attached to the shaft by silver chains. The three skull-heads grin maniacally at their new life. When the flail is used in combat the three heads bite the target, tearing and rendering flesh.

Veranon's flail is a vile looking weapon. The haft is crafted from jet black onyx with a pulsating red core. Fiery runes writhe along the length of the haft, almost as if they have a mind of their own. The haft is capped with a pommel stone, a blood red garnet. The weapon sports two heads, each the visage of an unknown but demonic looking creature. The eyes of the heads glow red and a sulpherous odor seems to emanate from the mouths. The heads appear to be crafted from lumps of coal, and yet are as hard as steel.

The weapon can only be wielded by those of evil alignment. In the hands of such an individual, the Flail of Veranon occasionally immolates its intended target. Otherwise it acts as any other flail.

@11529    = ~The Shackles of Roa +3~
@11530    = ~Lady Roa was a woman thrice betrayed. First by her lord father, who married her to Duke Sorim for political gain despite knowing that he would relentlessly torment young Roa. Second by her abusive husband the duke, who planted assassins amongst her handmaidens... when Roa visited her dearest brother Remin - a powerful baron - the assassins murdered him as he slept and so his lands passed to the duke. The third and final betrayal was at the hands of her sister Rana, who longed to take the duke, his riches, and eventually the royal crown for her own. Rana entwined herself in a plot with Duke Sorim to slay the king, discredit the true heir as his bastard child with Roa, and thereby steal the throne.

Roa, still less than sixteen summers old, was bound with a ball and chain and cast into the duke's infamous dungeons to await the completion of her husband and sister's terrible scheme. She sobbed and moaned day and night, her voice echoing through the keep's halls. The duke soon grew incensed at her constant wailing and sent one of his Ducal Guard to beat little Roa into silence. When the man arrived at the cell, he struck her across the face, shoved her to the ground and made to kick at her belly - but quick as that, Roa sprung up and strangled the man with her chains.

Moments later the willowy young girl burst into the duke's court and attacked him savagely. His guards pelted her with bolts from their crossbows, but onwards she charged. When she reached the Ducal Throne she tossed Sorim's champion aside like a broken doll, swinging the iron ball of her shackles with such strength that it stove in the shocked duke's thrice-enchanted breastplate of meteoric iron, driving shards of shattered ribs into his lungs and heart and killing him instantly.

No one is clear as to how the tale ends - some say that Roa then expired on the spot, her chest and back bristling with bolts, while others describe how her sister Rana leapt up and killed her with a dagger... a few optimistic souls even claim that Roa lived and spent the rest of her days in peaceful bliss. Whatever the case, her shackles remain as a testament to her story.

The chains of Roa's shackles have been looped and wound together in such a way that one can wield them as a flail. Crudely etched into the soft iron of the ball are the words "In Righteousness Lies My Strength."

When held, the chimes ring together, as if stirred by the wind, and no amount of padding or wrapping seems to silence the flail's chiming. When swung in combat, the chimes clash like thunder, having a chance of deafening anyone struck by it. 

This weapon is all that remains of Slow Cedric's Gallop, a small frontier settlement located in the Southern Pass of the Spine of the World Mountains. The settlement is believed to have been overrun by a tribe of orcs in the great winter of 1170 DR, and when the cold season passed, the settlement and the bodies of the townsfolk had been buried beneath great mountains of snow. When the first travelers braved the Pass in the spring season, they found only the top of the settlement's great stone belltower peeking through the mountainous drifts. This odd-looking flail was found lying upon the tower's bloodied stone floor, surrounded by the frost-dusted bodies of several dead orcs. 

According to tales, the Black Chimes were a symbol of office of the settlement's Bell Warden, whose duty was two-fold - to ring the warning bell when an enemy was sighted in the pass, and after the warning bell had been rung, to defend the pass with his life. It is believed the first Bell Warden of Slow Cedric's Gallop was the original creator of the Black Chimes, an enchanted flail that would ring to warn the town of danger at the same time as he leapt into battle against his foes.

Apparently overnight he had taken over an abandoned shop at the edge of small town. One day the shop was vacant and then the next it was boarded up tight with signs in every language telling passersby to go away. Infuriated, the previous owner demanded he leave, but quickly relinquished his claim to the shop when a large sack of gold appeared at his feet. The very next day, mysterious notes began to appear all over town. They all contained the same message and read as follows:

**************************************

Bring potatoes. Will pay in gold.

-Airon Broun

**************************************

Intrigued, a few townspeople decided to take him up on his offer and delivered sacks of potatoes to the shop. They would shove the potatoes into a delivery chute located in the back of the shop and then soon after a small sack of gold would appear, usually five times the going rate of the potatoes. The better the quality of the potatoes the more gold would appear. News soon spread of this wonderful offer and it was not long until every potato in town was sold to the curious gnome. No matter how many potatoes one delivered, there always appeared a sack of gold for payment. 

Needless to say, every farm for miles around started growing potatoes. Each farmer would try to outdo the other by producing the biggest and tastiest potatoes. This continued on for years until finally, the quality of potatoes was so good that instead of gold appearing, magic items of all sorts would appear. Not realizing the magical nature of the items given, the farmers sold them to passing merchants in disgust and stopped farming potatoes altogether. This hammer is one such item. By inserting special enchanted plates into the head of the hammer, the user is able to modify the abilities of the hammer. This particular hammer comes with plates that will do extra acid, cold, or fire damage.

Sophia, however, believed she was destined to marry one of the Duke's archers, a dashing young golden-haired fellow who roamed the surrounding lands felling foul beasts with a single twang of his mighty bow. As the tale goes, one of the court wizards (a transmuter) took pity on the young woman's plight and cast a spell that turned her into an arrow for an hour's time. The transmuter arranged for Sophia to be fired from the castle wall to a ship waiting off the coast, where she could sail to freedom.

The tale then breaks down from here, as numerous accounts claim that Sophia did not flee the coast safely, and that she transformed back into her normal body while she was halfway across the water, plunging into the icy ocean. Another school claims that, while in arrow form, Sophia pierced the side of the ship, then choked to death when she resumed her normal form with her neck embedded in the ship's hull. Still others claim that she was never even launched from the bow, and that she resumed her normal form while inside the archer's quiver, and she awoke, naked, wearing only the small band of leather about her body. When this last argument is made, the discussion generally deteriorates into a steady stream of sexual innuendos and the evening officially goes downhill.

Whatever the tale, the bow has a range unmatched by many other bows in the realms, and the arrows launched from it strike far and true - unlike the story surrounding the bow.

@11793    = ~Arc of Gold~
@11794    = ~It can be argued that the Arc of Gold and its sister, the Mithral Arc, brought about the end of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North many years past, and led to the destruction of the Severed Hand and the fall of Dorn's Deep. Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. 

At the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North, a disagreement arose between the two races over the matter of trading enchanted weapons to the men of the south, who were beginning to establish a foothold in the North. The dwarves were of the opinion that the many great works that had been built through the joint efforts of the dwarves and elves should be offered up to man and the profits used to fill the coffers of both races. This suggestion was not well-received by the elves nor by their leader, the arch-mage Larrel, and the matter was quickly dropped. 

However, when the Arc of Gold, one of the items fashioned jointly by dwarven and elven weaponsmiths was found in the hands of an orcish war party not long after the debate in the alliance councils, the elves accused the dwarves of selling the weapons to the goblinoids out of greed. The dwarves, insulted, broke the shafts of their hammers in the middle of the council and broke talks with the elves, returning to their halls in Dorn's Deep and never speaking to them again. The two races, now divided, were soon swallowed by the Dark Horde that was devouring the North beneath its banner. 

At the time of the fall of the Severed Hand, the Arc of Gold was mounted within the halls of Severed Hand as a reminder of the dwarven treachery and dwarven greed. When the Severed Hand fell, the Arc of Gold silently watched as the goblinoids tore apart the elvish defenders and laid waste to tower after tower, until the elvish archmage Larrel, in a desperate measure, brought about the Mythal cataclysm that sealed the fate of the Severed Hand once and for all. 

When the Mythal was cast, the Arc of Gold vanished from the halls of the Severed Hand and has not been seen since... until now.

Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. 

The Mithral Arc was developed at the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance, and it was one of the many joint items developed by the dwarves and elves of the Severed Hand before the destruction of the Severed Hand and the Fall of Dorn's Deep. Its accuracy was unparalleled, and the dwarves presented it to the elves as a token of goodwill between the races. The string of the bow was said to have been blessed by the elvish archmage Larrel himself, with a range that seemed to rival the horizon. It was mounted in the halls of Severed Hand so that all visitors could see it, and see the achievements the dwarves and elves united could bring about.

When its brother, the Arc of Gold, was discovered in the hands of a band of orcs raiding in the forests north of Severed Hand, the elves became furious and accused the dwarves of selling the relics the two races had jointly crafted to their enemies. The dwarves, enraged by the insult, seized the Mithral Arc and returned to Dorn's Deep, cutting off all contact with the elves. 

It is said that at the moment the alliance disbanded, the string of the Mithral Arc broke with a final twang, and the bow, useless, remained deep within Lower Dorn's Deep, silently watching as the dwarves were slowly driven deeper and deeper into the Deep by the encroaching goblinoid hordes that had begun to swarm down from the North. It was never seen and never taken by the Dark Horde that marched through Dorn's Deep, and the Mithral Arc remained there for countless years in the darkness with the dwarven dead piled around it, still clutching their weapons. 

How it came to be here is unknown, but the string of the Mithral Arc is restored and the bow is eager to be used. Perhaps there is hope for the fallen elves and dwarves still... or at least the opportunity to reclaim their once-proud homeland from the half-breed hordes that threaten it.

@11924    = ~To the northeast of the great tree-town of Kuldahar lies the Vale of Shadows, a valley of crypts and tombs where Kresselack the Black Wolf is said to be buried. Almost thirty years past, a band of adventurers entered the Vale of Shadows and returned with many relics and treasures taken from the tombs there. Rol-Sayid's Left Hand of Darkness is one such item, though its true purpose was not realized when it was discovered. Considered nothing more than the cast-off bandage of a mummy, it had been used to wrap a gold necklace lying in one of the sarcophagi in the tombs. 

The necklace's wrapping was discarded as soon as the band of adventurers returned to Kuldahar, and as they cast it away, the adventurers joked that it could serve some little boy as a sling if need be. One of the children of Kuldahar was quick to pick up on this comment, and he kept the sling both for hunting and as a good luck charm for several years. It is not known if he knew if the wrapping was magical or not, and he attributed the accuracy of the stones cast from it as his own natural ability rather than that of the sling. 

In truth, Rol-Sayid's Left Hand of Darkness is one of the wrappings from the left hand of one of Kresselack's lieutenants, who had been resurrected as a mummy within the tomb of his lord and served as a guardian against trespassers. When a stone is placed within the wrapping and spun with great force, the stone will fly straight and true at an enemy. Furthermore, as long as the wrapping is held in the hand, the wielder is immune to diseases, both magical and mundane.

@12156    = ~This instrument is also known as "Tallow's Violin," but that moniker is rarely spoken among musicians, as mentioning the name of Nikolai Tallow is considered bad luck. Nikolai was born in The Vast, near High Haspur, the son of a chandler. Because of the intermittent traffic through the region, Nikolai was introduced to many different cultures. One of the travelers he met was an elven musician named Relev Thinriver. Relev introduced Nikolai to the violin and taught him for several years as he wandered through the area. Relev knew that Nikolai was an incredibly gifted child, with quick fingers, a keen mind, and a passion for all things in the world. Relev also recognized that Nikolai was exceedingly proud and arrogant. In spite of Nikolai's shortcomings, Relev taught him everything he knew.

After Relev was killed by a band of orcs, Nikolai began to practice on his own throughout the Vast. Despite his travels, he always returned to the isolate peaks of his mountain birthplace. He became famed throughout the Vast, the southern Moonsea and Sembia for his incredible talent and passionate performances. Eventually, news of the proud young virtuoso spread to the ears of a nearby thug from Calaunt named Tremble Ghon. When Tremble and his gang traveled through the Elvenblood Pass, they stopped at the Elf in Armor Inn and demanded a performance from Nikolai, who happened to be present and eating dinner with his father at the time.

Nikolai refused to perform for Tremble and his men. He called them stinking oafs and attempted to leave with dignity. Tremble assaulted Nikolai's pride by claiming that Nikolai was afraid of performing because he'd be heckled out of the inn for his incompetence. Nikolai shot back that his skill with the violin was so great that he could raise the dead from their graves. Satisfied with a proposed challenge, Tremble immediately grabbed Nikolai's father and stabbed him in the heart. When a number of other villagers attempted to intervene, they were also killed by the bandits.

Tremble defiantly stood over Nikolai's dead father and said, "Where's your big mouth now, fiddle player?"  Without a word, Nikolai pulled his violin and bow out from underneath his arms and began to play a melody that none of the residents of High Haspur had ever heard before, and no one in Faerun would ever hear again. Nikolai played with unbridled passion and fervor. Onlookers later remarked that he appeared to be a madman, thrashing about in ways that people didn't think were possible. At the climax of his frenzied piece, Tremble and his gang watched in horror as the souls of the men and women they had just killed rose from their corpses and dove, shrieking, at their murderers. The bandits died horrible deaths, chilled by the shadows of their victims. Nikolai himself continued playing, dancing through the streets and back pastures of his alpine home until every man, woman, child, and beast ever buried in the region rose from its resting place and milled about until Nikolai and his music disappeared into a far off valley, shrouded in a mysterious fog that vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Legends say that on misty nights, the ghost of Nikolai Tallow returns to his homeland, playing a phantom violin with a host of dancing dead trailing behind him in the moonlight.

@12164    = ~When the venerable (and senile) red dragon Craum Straug wandered into the logging camp of Hornhollow at the edge of Wood of Sharp Teeth, the residents (wisely) fled in fear as the dragon began to belch flames, setting the camp on fire and causing cries of alarm to spread throughout the countryside. After the residents fled, Craum squatted his old bones down upon the blackened buildings, grumbling to himself and snorting flames from his nostrils. 

A few hours and several miles away, the residents of Hornhollow finally decided that someone must go negotiate with the dragon and see what it wanted. When no volunteers were forthcoming, a lottery was conducted - and the loser, a traveling ministrel, Aznee Fraystrings, was given the dangerous task of attempting to deal with the dragon. Aznee had lived out his welcome in the camp many nights previous, and the loggers considered it no great loss if Aznee gained a new home in the dragon's belly.

Aznee, somewhat absent-minded but of a brave heart, stumbled his way into the camp, and finally mustered the courage to speak with the dragon. During the (now-famous) exchange that followed, Aznee discovered that Craum, who was somewhat far along in dragon years and in none too good health, was suffering the draconic equivalent of a bad cough, and his hacking and wheezing masked his plaintive attempts to try and find someone, anyone, who could help cure his fits of coughing. 

Seeing a solution, Aznee offered a cure that helped an elderly uncle of his - a sprig of Maiden's Milk flower, that when crushed and administered in a tea, helped quell coughing in a matter of minutes. Some could undoubtably be found in the forest nearby, Aznee exclaimed, and he set about gathering up several sprigs and preparing them for the dragon. After lumping them into a great pot, he administered the steaming cauldron to the dragon.

It is suspected that either Craug drank the mixture too fast, or else Aznee had mistaken Bellows Root for Maiden's Milk, but whatever the reason, Craug vomited the mixture back out a few seconds later, setting fire to several acres of the wood and torching poor Aznee where he stood. After this vomitus belch, Craug ran wild for almost an hour, trying to spit out the remainder of the concoction. At the end of his rampage, the venerable red dragon fell over dead, the sudden flurry of activity more than his old bones could stand. 

When the loggers came to break down the dragon a day later, they discovered that Craum's bones still carried echoes of his coughing fits, and his entire skeleton creaked and wheezed, even after death. They struck a deal with a local mage, who bought the dragon's bones and fashioned a series of musical instruments with them, dubbed the "Pipes of the Wheezing Dragon."  These yellow bone pipes are famous throughout the Realms and, when used by a bard, they can be used to spit bursts of flames at opponents. Unfortunately, even when not in use, the pipes tend to creak and wheeze, attracting the attention of anyone nearby and making attempts at stealth and pick pocketing useless. 

A thin cord made of dragon gut is strung through the pipes, so they can be worn around the neck and can be easily played when danger threatens. The cord looks charred, as if it was burned recently, and is surprisingly tough.

//@12201    = ~Heart of Winter~ //HoF
@12202    = ~The Heart of Winter is often confused with the legendary Heartstone Gem, a powerful scrying artifact that serves as the heart of the great tree community of Kuldahar. The Heart of Winter is not an object, but an expression frequently used by the Uthgart tribes of the north to refer to a warrior or creature that has rid itself of all except one driving focus - usually revenge or hatred. The expression is often used to describe the barbarian lord, Wylfdene, who returned to lead the barbarian tribes in a campaign against the Ten-Towns in the Year of the Cold Soul (1281 Dale Reckoning). According to legend, Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of the shaman Jerrod, one of the barbarians greatest heroes and the one who sacrificed himself in the final battle against the archmage Arakon many hundreds of years ago. Claiming that his body had become home to Jerrod's spirit, Wylfdene rallied the tribes of the North to war to retake the lands that he claimed had been seized by the southerners of the Ten-Towns. Establishing a great war camp in Bremen's Run, a narrow canyon under the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, he fought several quick battles against the dwarves and townsfolk of the region until a small band of adventurers arrived in the town of Lonelywood to try to carve out a peace between the Ten-Towns and the barbarians. Their efforts at diplomacy are said to have failed, but they succeeded in defeating Wylfdene and saving the Ten-Towns from destruction. It is believed that these adventurers are the only reason the Ten-Towns exist (and thrive) to this day. 

What happened to these brave adventurers is unknown. The last known record of them is a sighting of them at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, where they spoke with a halfling traveler who claimed to know of a place where great riches could be found. Shortly after this, the adventurers and the halfling vanished and were never heard from again. 

After reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell. When a passage is recited from the book, it allows the reader to inflict the curse of the Heart of Winter upon foes, blinding them with its power or even freezing them where they stand.

//@12203    = ~Legends of Icewind Dale~ //HoF
@12204    = ~The greatest legends can stem from the humblest beginnings, and so it was with the band of adventurers that began their journey in the fishing community of Easthaven thirty years ago, 1281 Dale Reckoning. Meeting in the Winter's Cradle Tavern, this band of southerners had traveled north in search of adventure, and they were the first to join Hrothgar's expedition to investigate the rumor of troubles brewing in the great tree town of Kuldahar to the North, where a mighty oak, towering hundreds of feet high, sheltered a small town beneath its boughs with a life-giving warmth.

The misfortunes plaguing Icewind Dale led to the ambush of Hrothgar's expedition in the windswept Kuldahar Pass... and it left them the only survivors. Pressing on against goblinoid raiders that filled the Pass, the small band finally reached Kuldahar, only to discover the great tree was being threatened by an unknown evil deep within the mountains - if this evil was not stopped, Kuldahar would be destroyed, and the North itself might soon share the town's fate. 

The brave band of adventurers searched out this evil, their travels carrying them from the crypts of the Vale of Shadows through the numerous ruins of the North, including the decaying elven fortress of the Severed Hand and the lava-filled caverns of Dragon's Eye. Much of their journey has been lost, but there is no doubt that their efforts led to the salvation of Kuldahar and the Ten-Towns and their deeds are still spoken of in Easthaven and Kuldahar to this day. Hrothgar himself has been laid to rest in a small glen near the town of Kuldahar, in memory of his selflessness in coming to the aid of his neighbor in a time when Easthaven itself was suffering troubles of its own. 

Among their other acts of heroism, the adventurers are credited with the discovery of the location of the tomb of Kresselack the Black Wolf, one of the most infamous of the Northern generals, the discovery of the Severed Hand, and numerous other monasteries and ruins believed lost to time and the snows of the North.

After reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell. When a passage is recited from the book, it summons the howling winds of Icewind Dale to the reader's aid.

He was much loved by his family, servants, and those that lived upon his lands. Well after the elderly Lord Mensel had passed away in his sleep, a secret vault was found hidden beneath his study. Within the vault Mensel's heirs found a small hoard of treasure... and the Obscene Grimoire.

Though the origins of the grimoire and the identity of anyone associated with it - save the late Lord Mensel, of course - are still unknown, unwholesome rumors sprang up like mushrooms and still abound after nearly a century. The worst of the scandalous claims involved a seer from Arabel, a pious young man that seemed saddened to explain that Lord Mensel had the grimoire fashioned for himself at great expense and then slew all those involved in its making - an assertion that did no less than bring ruin to Mensel's name and family.

The unsavory book was cast into a temple brazier but, to the astonishment of numerous witnesses, it vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling vapor rather than bursting into flames. Since that day the Obscene Grimoire has appeared in many places, never found intentionally and always disappearing again within a few year's time.

The thick, black, leather-bound book is filled with painstakingly detailed woodblock prints, each depicting a gruesome scene of violent perversion. Even the briefest of glances through its disturbing pages is enough to assure the reader that no taboo is left unturned. However, for those willing to carefully peruse the disquieting work, there are dark runes and ritual directions hidden amongst the illumination around each print.

Prashnak used storms of acid to keep the trolls at bay. However the young mage was tiring of the constant attacks, and the trolls were becoming bolder.

After several months of studying the various effects of wilting magic, elemental summoning, and magical methods of frosting, Prashnak was finally ready to try his experiment. After summoning a water elemental, Prashnak evaporated choice bodily components and then froze the hapless creature. This lead to the creation of truly horrific sculptures of ice. The trolls, as simple as they are, took extreme offense to these totems and reportedly fled the area. The experiment a gleaming success, the exultant Prashnak continues his woeful studies to this day. What manner of thief took hold of the bracers is unknown, but they have been missing for several years.
