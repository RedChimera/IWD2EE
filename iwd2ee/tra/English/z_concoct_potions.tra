@4741     = ~Ichor can come from many sources, but the most convenient source is the bloodstream of a Bhaalspawn. In its unaltered state, the blood is little different from any other--extracting its true power is a complex process.

First, the Alchemist must conduct research into the parent deity and design a ritual to activate the hidden potential of the ichor. From there, the essence must be filtered out by leeching the blood with mummy wrappings, distillation, and precipitation in a centrifuge, producing a sweet-smelling golden liquid... or, in the case of ichor from evil deities, a foul mixture of grease and coarse dust.

Consuming the resulting substance is usually fatal; the purified ichor must be diluted and adapted to the user's system to have any positive effect. The exact method depends on the user, and requires intensive research and testing to discover. If the user is lucky, the method might be as harmless as crushing up some pearls and mixing the ichor with pumpkin juice and butter to produce an odd-flavored but perfectly drinkable potion.

If the user is unlucky, administering the dose might require vivisection.

Regardless of the method, the final result is a violent twisting of the digestive tract and the spread of the ichor through the user's body. The process is immensely painful and draining, permanently lowering the user's Constitution by 1 and dealing 10d10 poison damage with a save vs. death at -4 for half damage. If the user survives the process, he or she gains +1 to Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as the divine ichor suffuses their system.

If the user dies in the process, he or she may try again after being resurrected, but once the attempt is successful, further doses will have no affected on the imbued character.

By pouring the syrup over a magical item and then destroying it, an alchemist may infuse the syrup with disruptive forces. This may require destroying multiple magical items depending on their power.

When drunk, the syrup creates an anti-magic field around the user's body, automatically dispelling all dispellable effects (both positive and negative) as well as granting 30/- spell resistance for 10 rounds. The field also interferes with the user's own spells, if any, increasing spell failure by 50%.

Much of the science is unknown to humanoids, but an Alchemist may concoct a special version of the histachii brew from Yuan-ti lymph and mandrake root that will grant the drinker some limited resistance to poison. For 1 hour after the lymph is drunk, the user will enjoy 6/- poison resistance.

An alchemist must take special care when cultivating this moss, constantly making sure it has just the right amount of water and nutrients to thrive. Singing lullabies, burning incense, and paying compliments to the moss are all critical parts of the process.

Nurtured with love and blessed with plenty of exposure to moonlight, this moss will develop a faint glow. If the alchemist has treated it well, the moss will gladly spend its precious energy to bring a dead creature back to life.

Its power spent and its personality sacrificed for the sake of the alchemist's fallen comrade, the moss will lose its glow. The user is well advised to throw the moss away--keeping it around tends to make one somber, and the moss wouldn't want its best friend to be sad.
