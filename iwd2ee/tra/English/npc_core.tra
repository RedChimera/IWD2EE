For 10 rounds per level, Zack Boosenburry may call his loyal mount Aocha to battle. Aocha is a big furry spider and is far more sweet and cuddly than one might expect (or want), but in combat, she is no less dangerous than her wild relatives. She is innately immune to web effects and possesses a powerful venom, and will gladly rush to Zack's defense in times of danger.

If she should perish in the line of duty, Zack has a special formula in his pocket that can restore her to normal health, but she still needs 8 hours of rest to recover before Zack may summon her again.

@4863   = ~Stygian Ice Storm
(Conjuration)
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Will negates

Stygian Ice Storm is the signature spell of gelugons, though a lesser devil could also cast it upon growing powerful enough. When cast, it summons a storm of hellish ice from Stygia, the fifth layer of the Nine Hells. All creatures in the area of effect take 12d6 cold damage with no save, and must make a Will saving throw or be effectively feebleminded for 7 rounds due to the severe memory loss caused by Stygian ice. The caster is unaffected, as are undead creatures.~

@40002=~Good. We need all the men we can get.~
@40003=~That's the spirit! Now fall in line.~
@40004=~We could use an extra hand, if your arm is all right.~
@40005=~Why not come with us? We'll treat you to an ale - if you hadn't warned us about the goblins, we might have been taken by surprise.~
@40006=~Yes, I think I can fight. I lost my spear, but at least I can move my arm again. If we manage to put down those damn goblins, we should go report to Ulbrec in town.~
@40007=~Very well. Let's get moving.~
@40008=~Keep an eye out for goblin archers if you don't want to end up like Brohn. Keep an eye out and stay quiet... The goblins have the advantage of numbers, and we can't afford to get surrounded.~
@40009=~Got it.~
@40010=~My thanks, but the ale can wait. Let's report to Ulbrec. He needs to know what happened here.~
@40011=~Very well. Let's go.~
@40012=~If you know something of the future, perhaps you could come with us. It's always good to have another head and another pair of eyes, especially someone who won't die to a single stray arrow.~

     - Until the shadow is banished from our future -~
@40019=~I am grateful, Veira. Let's defend this town together.~
@40020=~I've never been friends with a ghost before, but I guess there's a first time for anything. Come on, let's get going.~
@40021=~We've got the leader right here. The others should be coming shortly.~
@40022=~I have used most of my power journeying here and fighting these orcs. I relied upon scrolls to make it this far. I cannot do this on my own. I need your aid in this matter.~
@40023=~A troll is a dangerous adversary. I will consider it.~
@40024=~Join us and we'll help those villagers together.~
@40025=~Would you consider joining us? The horde has laid claim to Shaengarne Bridge, and Lord Ulbrec has asked us to retake the bridge. We would be grateful if you would lend us your assistance.~
@40026=~Well, you will at least leave here with my blessing. If I can be of any other aid to you, you need only ask.~
@40027=~These orcs have concerned me as well. If you need any assistance, I will gladly provide it. What needs to be done?~
@40028=~We need to march to Shaengarne Bridge and drive away the orcs. It's an important route for Targos, and we can't let it fall.~
@40029=~Kill orcs. Kill goblins. Anything that gets in the way, honestly.~
@40030=~Very well. Lead the way and we can fight back the horde together.~
@40031=~An odd way of putting it, but I am no stranger to combat. I will do whatever it takes to keep these villagers safe.~
@40032=~Yes. It would be wrong for me to just stay here and ignore their plight, even though I lack my moonblade. I will travel with you.~
@40033=~Very well. Even without my moonblade, I can put up a fight. Let us go.~
@40034=~You have returned. How may I... is that the troll who stole my blade?~
@40035=~We required the troll's assistance for tackling the horde. I'm sorry, but Vrek's condition was that we could not hand over the blade. The sword is a threat to him and we cannot relinquish it.~
@40036=~Sorry, Emma, but we have a stronger ally on hand. We can't give you the sword. Vrek here sees it as a threat.~
@40037=~You traded my moonblade for the loyalty of a *troll?* Return my sword, pig, or I will take it by force!~
@40038=~I cannot do that, priestess. Vrek and I had a deal, and I have to set priorities. The sword is ours now.~
@40039=~I'd like to see you try. Vrek, shall we?~
@40040=~I cannot defeat you right now, but I will come back with allies!~
@40041=~You will not escape us, priestess!~
@40042=~That's quite clever, Vrek. You've created your own little kingdom, set up a food supply, removed an important threat... You're a very intelligent troll.~
@40043=~Vrek think often. Vrek see things orc not see. Orc not know things Vrek know.~
@40044=~What do you see that the orcs don't?~
@40045=~Emma isn't the only one with a magical weapon. There are weapons like hers all across Faerun - what if another human comes by with a magic sword?~
@40046=~Orc not have plan. Only Vrek have plan. Vrek put together pieces. Now Vrek control orc and human and world.~
@40047=~Not anymore, Vrek. I'm breaking up this little "kingdom" of yours.~
@40048=~The world has a lot more to offer than a few humans. You don't have any higher ambitions? Gold, power, an army? An intelligent troll could do much more than this.~
@40049=~You don't control the whole world just yet. Emma's sword is not the only one that can hurt you.~
@40050=~Vrek not eat gold. Vrek eat meat. Human meat best.~
@40051=~Your humans are already gone. The orcs killed them when I intruded on the camp.~
@40052=~Your humans are already gone. I killed their orc guards and set them free.~
@40053=~I can't let you keep doing this, Vrek.~
@40054=~Orc kill human? You ruin plan! Vrek has no food!~
@40055=~You take human? You ruin plan! Vrek has no food!~
@40056=~Maybe not. But join my group and we'll have lots of meat for you every day.~
@40057=~Vrek no join you. You take Vrek's food. Vrek kill you and eat!~
@40058=~If new human come with new magic sword, Vrek will find - take sword, no fear.~
@40059=~That's not going to happen. I'm ending this operation.~
@40060=~What if you don't see it coming? What if the next blade is hidden? You need other people to help you look for them. People like us.~
@40061=~Vrek no trust human. Human hate Vrek.~
@40062=~I need help fighting the goblin horde, and I'll take whatever help I can get, even from a troll. If you help me kill the orcs at the bridge, I'll help you look out for magic weapons like Emma's... You can even get a share of our gold.~
@40063=~I'm not a human, but I need help fighting the goblin horde, and I'll take whatever help I can get, even from a troll. If you help me kill the orcs at the bridge, I'll help you look out for magic weapons like Emma's... You can even get a share of our gold.~
@40064=~Vrek not eat gold. Vrek already have food and healer blade.~
@40065=~Then there's no reasoning with you. Your reign ends here, Vrek.~
@40066=~Maybe not. But I can offer you better. Join my group and we'll have lots of meat for you every day.~
@40067=~Maybe not. But I can offer you better. Join my group and we'll have lots of meat for you every day. I wouldn't mind a troll on the team - in fact, an intelligent troll would be very welcome.~
@40068=~You have gold? Give Vrek meat? Keep healer sword away?~
@40069=~Come with us and you can have all the food you want and more. All you have to do is help us kill the orcs near the bridge. They don't have magic weapons; it should be easy for a troll.~
@40070=~Vrek... Vrek say yes. But if human give sword to healer, Vrek kill human.~
@40071=~That's good enough for me. Come along... we have orcs to slay.~
@40072=~I want you gone, just like all the other goblins. You can leave without a fight or you can join the corpses I've left scattered behind me.~
@40073=~Yes.  Don't look so surprised, just because I'm a goblin doesn't mean I don't think. I am Vunarg, the chief of the Vunarg Clan, and I have responsibility to them. We must eat and hunt and war. Here we have none of those things. Well, none yet; we wait for now.~
@40074=~Interesting. Die, scum!~
@40075=~I've heard enough. Die, scum!~
@40076=~Yes. We're going to take this horde down. We're already halfway through.~
@40077=~If you came here to shed blood and earn gold, why not join the winning team? You clearly don't owe any loyalty to the horde, the horde has no loyalty to you, and I have no objection to working with a goblin.~
@40078=~Heh. In any other situation, I'd chop you apart. But I've been considering leaving this place for a long time now. I'll let you wrestle with the orcs and the bugbears - my people would be happier elsewhere, anyway. Farewell, townie scum.~
@40079=~The winning team? You really believe you can bring down the horde?~
@40080=~The horde is strong. But it's not as strong as us. How do you think we got this far without dying?~
@40081=~The horde isn't as strong as it seems. We've already gotten this far.~
@40082=~You must be deluded, or at least foolishly brave. I doubt you can stop Guthma, and I'm not going to risk my life helping a half-witted townie fight for a dying cause.~
@40083=~And you expect me to help you fight the horde when you're already hopelessly outnumbered?~
@40084=~It's true that we're outnumbered. But we're a lot *less* outnumbered than we were when we got here.~
@40085=~Yes. Would you rather fight us instead? Because a lot of other goblins already made that mistake.~
@40086=~What exactly are you offering me? What happens if you manage to kill Guthma?~
@40087=~You join the fight, you get a share of the gold. Simple as that.~
@40088=~What's to stop you from killing me after Guthma is dead? Isn't Targos committed to killing every goblin in sight?~
@40089=~Why kill an ally right after he's proven his worth to the group? Why kill a goblin who's fighting on our side?~
@40090=~We could carry you on a gilded palanquin into the streets of Targos shouting praises to your name and all goblinkind, and no one could dare tell us we were wrong to do it. We're the heroes of Targos - we saved the entire town from goblins, twice. Who's going to question our judgment?~
@40091=~Lord Ulbrec never said we *couldn't* make friends with goblins.~
@40092=~Let me speak with my clan about this...~
@40093=~My clan is against it. They have no interest in fighting to defend a human city. However, I'm willing to help you take the fight to Guthma, for a share of the loot. I know the horde is wealthy, and bringing back some of that gold will make my clan far stronger.~
@40094=~One goblin is good enough. Welcome to the team, Vunarg.~
@40095=~I like your attitude. Let's go kill some orcs.~
@40096=~I don't like the idea of aiding a goblin clan, but the help is worth the price.~
@40097=~We should be careful. There's a trap under an archway leading to some tunnels higher up, and that area is much more heavily populated. There aren't just goblins and orcs; they have ogres and trolls and orogs and even some spellcasters, as well as an otyugh, though that last one's locked up in a cage. We can't get any farther unless we have two wardstones, one made of black stone and one of solid iron. A hobgoblin has one; the orog chief has the other. We need the stones to pass some wards leading upstairs.~
@40098=~Good to know.~
@40099=~Once we get up top, we'll be surrounded by orc archers, and it won't be long before the others join in. Orcs, ice trolls, goblins, bugbears, orogs, shamans and witch doctors and goblin sorcerers, and even some hill giants with spears. Be careful not to fall for the spellcasters' enchantments or we'll be overwhelmed. I'm not familiar with Guthma's headquarters, but I have seen spellcasters head in and out, as well as clan leaders of every race. Guthma himself is the largest of the bugbears, and he carries an enchanted morningstar, so we should give him a very wide berth if possible.~
@40100=~I'm glad we got the warning before we ran into that. Come on, let's go.~
@40101=~If you cannot leave until that voice is banished, perhaps we could make a deal. What could you offer me in exchange for your freedom?~
@40102=~We've already banished Aeij-Kllenzr't - Caged Fury. He was the spirit of a tempest bound to an altar downstairs.~
@40103=~Yes, we banished the spirit of the tempest bound to the altar below.~
@40104=~Thankfully, a disease has been purged from my mind, like ice inside a blazing inferno. You have lived up to your end of the bargain, mortal, and I shall live up to mine. I shall help you bring down this Legion.~
@40105=~I knew you would. Shall we?~
@40106=~We no longer have room for you in our group, devil. Take your freedom and go.~
@40107=~Very well. Good luck, mortal - you may well need it.~
@40108=~Farewell, Xhaan.~
@40109=~I can offer many things, mortal. What is it that you want?~
@40110=~An ally. If I set you free, then you will join me and help me defeat the Legion of the Chimera.~
@40111=~Gold. That is the price of your freedom.~
@40112=~Power. I will trade your freedom for a portion of your life force.~
@40113=~The Legion is responsible for our imprisonment. I would gladly aid in their destruction. I agree to your terms.~
@40114=~It is done, then. I have already banished Aeij-Kllenzr't - Caged Fury. He was the spirit of a tempest bound to an altar downstairs.~
@40115=~Excellent. I will return when the task is done.~
@40116=~Mortals are ever predictable. With my freedom, I could grant this wish - a thousand gold pieces, in the local coin.~
@40117=~Of all things, an adventurer can appreciate the allure of power. With my freedom, I could grant this wish - a portion of my life force, transferred from my being to yours.~
@40118=~What of my reward?~
@40119=~I promised you nothing, mortal - I merely said I had the *power* to grant your request. Our dealings are done. Farewell.~
@40120=~You will pay for this! You are going back to the Hells the hard way!~
@40121=~I should have expected no less from a devil. Take your freedom and begone.~
@40122=~Zack's the name... Zack Boosenburry... illusionist and faithful of Baervan Wildwanderer. Have you-excuse me for a moment. Aocha? *Aocha?* AOCHA?!~
@40123=~You're an illusionist? Does that mean you have spells to sell?~
@40124=~Aocha - come here girl! *PHHIRRR!* Oh, I almost forgot - fumbling around inside that worm I hit upon a few items. If there's anything I can do for you, let me know.~
@40125=~We're happy for you. Farewell.~
@40126=~Actually, we could use your help. Would you consider joining us?~
@40127=~Aocha... AOCHA...! A good mount she was... Perhaps her death was inevitable, <CHARNAME> - being who... *what* she was. If I was nearby, I could have rescued her, but...~
@40128=~We could use your help. Would you consider joining us?~
@40129=~I can consider all sorts of things. What do you need help with?~
@40130=~We intend to destroy that glacier blocking the pass. Lord Ulbrec sent us to meet with the Neverwinter soldiers, and this ice wall is blocking the way.~
@40131=~We need to send word to Targos about the Aurilites' activities here. Without the airship we used to travel here, we'll need to make our way to Kuldahar through the Eastern Pass. We could use your help getting there.~
@40132=~I came here to study the glacier - the enchantments on the ice are fascinating. I'd hate to see it fall before I had a chance to research it!~
@40133=~You'll have plenty of time to study the wall. In fact, I don't know if we even *could* bring down the wall before we researched it. Why not come along with us to study it? You'll need protection from all these Aurilites.~
@40134=~Good point. I certainly don't want to get devoured by another one of those worms, either. I'll help you bring down the wall, as long as I have some time to take notes. Just let me get Aocha first.~
@40135=~Aocha's coming with us?~
@40136=~Of course! She's quite friendly, though she can be quite a bruiser when we're in trouble. I usually keep her in my pocket - she's safer there.~
@40137=~You keep a giant spider in your pocket?~
@40138=~It's one of my little inventions. I designed a magical pocket for her to hide in! It comes in handy when I need to go into town - you wouldn't believe how many people are scared of her! I also have a special formula in there, just in case she gets hurt. Let me shrink her down and put her in my pocket, and I'll be ready to go...~
@40139=~Done! Aocha is comfortable, and I'm all set. Shall we?~
@40140=~Sounds like a fair trade for saving my life and Aocha, and with the ice wall broken, there's not much left for me here, anyway. Very well, I can tag along for a while. Just let me get Aocha first.~
@40141=~Actually, I was wondering if you would be willing to join our group. We have room for a budding sorceress.~
@40142=~Why wait? We have room for another sorcerer in our group. You could come along with us.~
@40143=~If you want to learn more about magic, we have room for another sorcerer in our group. You could come along with us.~
@40144=~If you want to learn more, we have room for another sorcerer on our travels. You could join us, if you want.~
@40145=~Wait! I must ask... there is magic - sorcery - coursing through my blood. No one here can teach me, but I don't wish to leave the village on my own just yet. Can you help me?~
@40146=~If you want to learn more about magic, we have room for a sorcerer in our group. You could come along with us.~
@40147=~You would take me with you? I don't know what to say - this is so exciting!~
@40148=~Just say yes.~
@40149=~It could be dangerous. You'd learn a lot, but you'd be taking a lot of risks, too. Are you sure you're up to it?~
@40150=~Yes! Yes, I'll do it! I can't wait to get started. All the places we'll go, all the things we'll see...~
@40151=~Welcome to the group, Pairi. You're now one of the heroes of Targos.~
@40152=~Fall in line, Pairi. We've got a long march ahead of us.~
@40153=~I can teach you more, if you like. I've been practicing my skills all across Icewind Dale and I've learned far more than I did when I was training in a cramped little room. We could use a dedicated and energetic monk like you.~
@40154=~You know, there's no better teacher than experience. If you want to improve your skills, we could use a dedicated monk. You can learn a lot from adventuring, and not just about the martial arts.~
@40155=~Leave the monastery? But I've learned so much here - and my training isn't done yet!~
@40156=~If you need outside help just to convince your teacher to do his job, then I think you're going to keep hitting mental walls. Why don't you go get your last lesson while Svaltid is feeling helpful, then come with us?~
@40157=~I've always wanted to travel Faerun... That's how I got to the monastery in the first place, but I settled down to practice my skills. It suppose it depends on where you're going and what you're doing.~
@40158=~The Ten Towns are in danger. The Legion of the Chimera is moving to attack all of them, so we're moving to defend all of them.~
@40159=~Wherever the wind takes us next... which appears to be the depths of the Underdark, and all the horrible creatures therein. Sounds fun, doesn't it?~
@40160=~We're on a mission from Lord Ulbrec of Targos to bring down the Legion of the Chimera. We've had to trek all across Icewind Dale to get where we are. As for where we're going, it starts with the Underdark passage, but after that, it could be anywhere.~
@40161=~Gold, mostly. It tends to run out fast... We have some expensive habits.~
@40162=~We have certain grievances with the Legion of the Chimera and its various allies - namely, their constant attempts to kill us. We intend to wipe them out.~
@40163=~Practicing our skills, just like you. A constant drive towards self-perfection - which happens to coincide with a mission to save the Ten Towns from the Legion of the Chimera.~
@40164=~We're killing monsters. We go where the monsters are and then we kill them.~
@40165=~Aside from defeating the Legion of the Chimera? We're seeing the sights. Enjoying the weather. Meeting new people. Making discoveries.~
@40166=~I don't really know.~
@40167=~That, um... That sounds like it could be interesting. But I think I am better off staying here. I have friends at the monastery and, uh... many things to do. But I do appreciate you talking to Svaltid for me. Thank you.~
@40168=~I understand. Farewell, Sersa.~
@40169=~That... actually sounds interesting. But I have so many things to learn here, too... I can't say right now. Let me go do my training with Svaltid and sleep on it. I'll talk to you again in the morning...~
@40170=~Very well. I will see you then.~
@40171=~I've seen the monks here and the teachers have great skill. But you are already approaching the limit of what they can teach you. I see great talent in you. Perhaps it's time to leave home and go out in search of more knowledge.~
@40172=~Maybe... But I need to know more about what I'm getting into. Tell me, where are you going, exactly?~
@40173=~That... actually sounds interesting. But I'm not sure... I can't say right now. I need to sleep on this. Give me a day and I'll talk to you again in the morning.~
@40174=~I'm not sure... I can't say right now. I need to sleep on this. Give me a day and I'll talk to you again in the morning.~
@40175=~I've thought about what you've said and... my answer is yes. I'd be delighted to join your group. I've already spoken to Salisam and he said it's a good opportunity for me. I'm sure there are things I'll miss by leaving the monastery, but that's the cost of trying new things. I have my things together - which basically just means me - and I'm ready to go.~
@40176=~I've thought about what you've said and... my answer is yes. I'd be delighted to join your group. I've already spoken to Aruma and she said it's a good opportunity for me. I'm sure there are things I'll miss by leaving the monastery, but that's the cost of trying new things. I have my things together - which basically just means me - and I'm ready to go.~
@40177=~Great. Let's get started.~
@40178=~Never seen someone so sulky just because he has to do his duty.~
@40179=~I don't appreciate being bullied into marching around in the cold. I came here to fight and profit; not freeze my stones off in the snow with boys playing at being soldiers.~
@40180=~Playing at being soldiers? You and your band of mercenaries were-~
@40181=~We're not *mercenaries,* boy! We-~
@40182=~You were drinking yourselves to death while the *real* men were outside fighting the goblins.~
@40183=~Seems like the goblins were doing all the fighting. Say, how's your arm, boy? Think you can still put up a fight?~
@40184=~Threaten me again, mercenary. Spend a day in the stocks and you'll change your tone.~
@40185=~And who the hell are you to put me in the stocks, boy? You don't look much like that old crow at the palisade to me.~
@40186=~I'm a soldier, cutthroat. And I'd be glad to help introduce you to military discipline. I think you could benefit.~
@40187=~Don't play with me, boy. I'm in no mood.~
@40188=~Are we to continue fighting together?~
@40189=~Yes, let's go.~
@40190=~Not right now, but I might come back soon. Wait here.~
@40191=~No, unfortunately.~
@40192=~Did you change your mind? Am I free to go?~
@40193=~No, you are still coming with me.~
@40194=~No, but I will not escort you. Go over to Shawford at the palisade or your little mercenary group will likely be jailed.~
@40195=~Are you sure you don't want me back? We've been making quite a bit of gold.~
@40196=~Sure, come along.~
@40197=~Not right now, but I might come back soon. Wait here.~
@40198=~No, I don't.~
@40199=~- It seems you do not wish I follow you -
- Perhaps my debt to you is finally paid -
- And I can depart this realm forever -~
@40200=~Not yet, Veira. I reconsidered. I appreciate your assistance.~
@40201=~Not yet. Please wait here for me, and I might come back.~
@40202=~Yes, it is time you depart. Thank you, Veira. You've earned your rest many times over.~
@40203=~Do you not want me in the party? I am willing to leave, but it is best we stay together.~
@40204=~Sure, you can come along.~
@40205=~For now, we will split up, but I might come back.~
@40206=~You not work with Vrek any longer? Then maybe Vrek eat you instead...~
@40207=~Wait, I changed my mind. Rejoin the party.~
@40208=~I will see you dead, filthy troll.~
@40209=~I should've expected as much from townie scum. You have five seconds to take that back or I'm leaving forever to return to my tribe.~
@40210=~Never mind, you're still in the party.~
@40211=~You can go.~
@40212=~...~
@40213=~We should've killed you when we met you. Time to rectify that!~
@40214=~You separated me tens of miles from my tribe only to ditch me!? I'll cut you to pieces for that, scum!~
@40215=~Wait! You're still in the party. Sorry about that.~
@40216=~We'll see about that.~
@40217=~If our alliance is finished, then I will take my leave, mortal. I still have my revenge to exact, and I will not wait for you to come back to me.~
@40218=~Wait, I changed my mind. Our alliance still stands.~
@40219=~Good riddance.~
@40220=~It was a mistake to ever ally with you. Defend yourself!~
@40221=~Too bad you don't want me in the party anymore. I was starting to enjoy it here.~
@40222=~Actually, you can stay. Come along.~
@40223=~It's okay; we may come back for you later.~
@40224=~Why would you leave without me? Please let me come!~
@40225=~Sure, let's go! I don't know what I was thinking before.~
@40226=~I will return for you soon; don't worry.~
@40227=~Unfortunately, we will have to part ways.~
@40228=~It seems you have reconsidered. Should I stay here in the monastery?~
@40229=~It seems you have reconsidered. Should I go back to the monastery?~
@40230=~It seems you have reconsidered. Should I go back to the monastery? It will be a long walk, but I think I can do it.~
@40231=~Actually, let us resume our travels.~
@40232=~Yes, stay here.~
@40233=~Just wait a little while and I will come back.~
@40234=~Yes, you should probably return there.~
@40235=~Targos needs all the help it can get, but I don't think bringing a troll along with us is safe. What happens when the tide of battle turns against us? That beast is going to desert us the moment it thinks we're in danger-or worse, join the horde and turn on us. We need allies, yes, but we need allies we can *trust.*~
@40236=~Leadership means taking risks. I don't trust Vrek, either, but we need the extra muscle. A troll is a powerful enemy and a powerful friend. We've got enough enemies as it is.~
@40237=~I don't like arrows. I'd rather them sink into Vrek's hide than mine.~
@40238=~To be honest, I was just improvising... We were surrounded; I wasn't sure we'd make it out alive. I didn't think I'd end up traveling with him. It just sort of happened.~
@40239=~Noted. Now keep walking, soldier.~
@40240=~A dead enemy is better than a false friend.~
@40241=~I mean, we could stab him in his sleep if we thought he would turn on us anyway, but I'm not sure that would actually kill him.~
@40242=~Think of him as a mercenary. He's just paid in meat instead of gold. You've fought alongside mercenaries before, haven't you?~
@40243=~We don't know which one he is yet. But I'll keep an eye out, Reig.~
@40244=~Better make that decision too soon than too late. I don't want to be caught off-guard again.~
@40245=~I have. But they're not loyal, and I've never trusted them. At least a normal mercenary belongs to a company with a reputation to maintain. Trolls don't care where their meat comes from. We all taste the same to them. Watch yourself.~
@40246=~Good. I will, too.~
@40247=~A friend will take an arrow for you. Vrek isn't a friend. He's just a wild dog looking for scraps.~
@40248=~Dogs can be put down if they bite back. Until then, keep your voice down and play nice. We've got bigger problems coming up soon.~
@40249=~That's a pretty damn ugly dog.~
@40250=~Dogs can take arrows just fine.~
@40251=~You should take this more seriously. Lives are at stake, and not just ours. Let's keep going. I can watch our backs, but I don't want to be the only one looking out for the group.~
@40252=~Quick thinking. But you can't talk your way out of everything. I've talked my way out of a couple of bar fights, but I couldn't talk down the goblins at the docks. We might still need to trade swords with the troll.~
@40253=~We'll see, Reig.~
@40254=~I'll give it some thought. Until then, keep your voice down and play nice. We've got bigger problems coming up soon.~
@40255=~Better to trade words before you trade swords. Swords are pointy.~
@40256=~Just don't let your guard down. We might just be delaying the inevitable.~
@40257=~First the troll and now a goblin. At this rate we'll be more horde than human.~
@40258=~Not everyone who stands against the horde is a human, Reig. Elves stand by your side as well.~
@40259=~Not everyone who stands against the horde is a human, Reig. Dwarves stand by your side as well.~
@40260=~Not everyone who stands against the horde is a human, Reig. Halflings stand by your side as well.~
@40261=~Not everyone who stands against the horde is a human, Reig. I'm half-elf, and I stand by your side as well.~
@40262=~Not everyone who stands against the horde is a human, Reig. A drow stands by your side as well.~
@40263=~Not everyone who stands against the horde is a human, Reig. A half-orc stands by your side as well.~
@40264=~Not everyone who stands against the horde is a human, Reig. Gnomes stand by your side as well.~
@40265=~I don't see what you're complaining about. I like having a goblin who's not trying to kill us for once.~
@40266=~At least the goblin is less ugly.~
@40267=~I'm getting weary of your prejudices, Reig. I'm also getting weary of you challenging my decisions. I'm the only reason you're alive and Targos is still standing.~
@40268=~I haven't forgotten. But you've always been standing with us. The goblin would be trying to split us open if we met on the field.~
@40269=~Count yourself lucky we didn't. Let's keep moving. I already know how you feel about Vrek; I don't need to hear the same lecture about Vunarg.~
@40270=~Now he's not, and you have me to thank. You're welcome. Now keep your mouth shut.~
@40271=~You could say the same of me. Gods know my kind hasn't always gotten along with yours. Maybe we should be grateful there are exceptions.~
@40272=~Maybe. But those exceptions don't come cheap. I'll give the goblin a chance, but I won't forget what he is.~
@40273=~For now. I'll give the goblin a chance, but I won't forget what he is.~
@40274=~You're too trusting. It's going to get you a knife in the back someday. I'll watch your back, but I want to know you're watching mine, too.~
@40275=~I am, Reig, and I don't appreciate you suggesting I'm not.~
@40276=~Don't worry, Reig. I am.~
@40277=~I will. But as long as Vunarg is fighting alongside us, we'll be watching his back, too.~
@40278=~I haven't forgotten. But goblins killed my brothers down at the docks, and they would have killed me, too. I have good reason to be suspicious. This goblin has spent a lifetime butchering my people.~
@40279=~I haven't forgotten, either, Reig. But I need you to fight alongside him nonetheless.~
@40280=~And you his. But there are exceptions. We're not always at war.~
@40281=~Sorry, but I want to be clear. You're taking another risk, and I'm noticing. Keep it up and we'll find ourselves outnumbered.~
@40282=~Never thought I'd find myself fighting alongside a goblin. Not sure I like it.~
@40283=~I don't see what you're complaining about. I like having a goblin who's not trying to kill us for once. ~
@40284=~Get used to it. If he fights well, he'll be with us a long time. We need strong warriors.~
@40285=~Your prejudices are showing, Reig.~
@40286=~And how long is that going to last? This goblin has spent a lifetime butchering my people. That's not going to change after just one conversation.~
@40287=~Perhaps not. But we'll have to cross that bridge when we reach it.~
@40288=~I know. But I need you to fight alongside him nonetheless.~
@40289=~I'm not naive, Reig. I know what he is. But I'm the reason he's not trying to kill us. You're welcome. Now keep your mouth shut.~
@40290=~We need strong warriors we can *trust.* This goblin has spent a lifetime killing my people. It would be trying to split us open if we met on the field.~
@40291=~Count yourself lucky we didn't. Let's keep moving.~
@40292=~But he's not, and you have me to thank. You're welcome. Now keep your mouth shut.~
@40293=~You could say the same of me. Gods know my kind hasn't always gotten along with yours. Maybe we should be grateful there are exceptions.~
@40294=~For now. I'll give the goblin a chance, but I won't forget what he is.~
@40295=~Goblins killed my brothers down at the docks, and they would have killed me, too. I have good reason to be suspicious. This goblin has spent a lifetime butchering my people.~
@40296=~And you his. But there are exceptions. We're not always at war.~
@40297=~I know. But I need you to fight alongside him nonetheless.~
@40298=~Maybe. But those exceptions don't come cheap. I'll give the goblin a chance, but I won't forget what he is.~
@40299=~Are we really going to trust the word of a demon? We-~
@40300=~Listen *carefully,* human. I am not a demon, but a devil, a creature of law and purpose. We devils *kill* demons; they are our ancient enemies. Being called a demon is a great insult to our kind.~
@40301=~Be assured, I am willing work with this group toward my revenge on the Legion of the Chimera. But call me a demon again and you will die painfully.~
@40302=~Very well, devil. Though what were you saying before? About demons being your enemies?~
@40303=~We devils have been fighting demons for countless millennia in what mortals call the Blood War. A conflict beyond your ken, mortal, and far older than your petty gods.~
@40304=~A war over what?~
@40305=~Many things. The struggle between law and chaos. The glory of bloodshed and the pursuit of power. The promise of advancement to a higher form... I hope to become a red abishai or even a cornugon if I may distinguish myself to Tiamat. And I cannot describe the thrill of hunting manes and dretches and showing them their weakness and impotence in the face of a superior being.~
@40306=~Yep. Devils can be feisty critters.~
@40307=~They're devils, Reig. All they know is sadism and cruelty. I would never wish to see inside their minds.~
@40308=~I know the feeling all too well, devil. There's no greater purpose than serving one's lord.~
@40309=~I know your lord. Maglubiyet is a worthy god. I think you and I will get along well, goblin.~
@40310=~I should have known better than to ask. I changed my mind; keep your thoughts to yourself.~
@40311=~A wise choice.~
@40312=~Be on your guard. Goblins are dangerous creatures, but orcs are even worse. I've been hunting here before, and there are many places for archers to wait in hiding. Don't let our victory at the palisade let you lower your guard. It only takes moments to find yourself roasting over an orc band's campfire.~
@40313=~It feels good to finally have the horde on the defensive. We have a tall hill to climb, though. The horde won't be expecting us, but we're more outnumbered than ever. We should pick our battles and be careful about who we engage. If we draw too much attention, we could be overwhelmed.~
@40314=~Thank Tymora we're still alive. Oswald might be absentminded, but we'd be dead if he hadn't reinforced the hull so well.~
@40315=~I think this is more the work of Beshaba than Tymora.~
@40316=~Reig, what's gotten into you? You almost sound optimistic for once.~
@40317=~I wish we had asked Elytharra to help enchant the airship. We might have been able to stay afloat.~
@40318=~We still have to get past those priests that brought us down. That will be even harder to do on foot.~
@40319=~I've cursed Beshaba more than I've thanked Tymora, and I think that's why I've had such sour luck. I'm trying to stay positive.~
@40320=~We've gotten a lot farther than I ever would have expected. Wasn't so long ago I was in Targos wondering how long it'd take before I'd get hacked apart by goblins. Back then, all I hoped for was to take as many of the vermin down with me as I could.~
@40321=~And now you fight alongside one. How much do you hate it?~
@40322=~I didn't think we'd get this far, either. The fortress was a glorious fight, wasn't it?~
@40323=~How many have you taken down so far, do you think?~
@40324=~It's good to be alive. Let's keep it that way.~
@40325=~We've still got a long way to go. We still have to get past those priests that brought us down.~
@40326=~I don't mind it so much these days. You're a good soldier, Vunarg.~
@40327=~As are you, townie.~
@40328=~It's too late now. No sense wishing for something we can't have.~
@40329=~True, but I'm not happy about it. We're so far behind now.~
@40330=~Let's move on. We still have to get past those priests that brought us down.~
@40331=~Right. We're running late to meet with the Neverwinter troops, but let's not get too hasty. We're got a new enemy to deal with, I think, and we don't know their strength, or even who they are.~
@40332=~We've talked long enough. I'm ready to go.~
@40333=~Yes, but it hardly made up for the slaughter at Targos before you showed up. I still wish I had not lost my brother.~
@40334=~At my last count, I've killed <EXKILLCOUNT>. But those priests that brought our ship down will likely be fiercer foes than the goblins we faced before.~
@40335=~So we're off to the Underdark. This just keeps getting more complicated. I don't know anything about the Underdark, other than it's infested with drow and other evil creatures.~
@40336=~It's a dangerous place. Mind flayers, umber hulks, beholders, and duergar-and a drow war band can be deadlier than them all.~
@40337=~It's a dangerous place. Mind flayers, umber hulks, beholders, and drow-and a duergar war band can be deadlier than them all.~
@40338=~Drow are just a fraction of the horrors down there. There are also duergar, mind flayers, umber hulks, beholders, and others.~
@40339=~It's an evil place indeed. We svirfneblin are among the only beings that can be trusted down there.~
@40340=~More than you can imagine, iblith.~
@40341=~It's not a safe place for a surfacer. And without a local house insignia, my skin won't be enough to endear me to my fellow drow, if we run into any. We'd best come well-prepared.~
@40342=~There are also other duergar down there. And I might not get along with them any better than you will.~
@40343=~Don't worry, friend. I will be your eyes when things get dark.~
@40344=~It is also dark, though my half-orc eyes should be able to see down there.~
@40345=~I know little of the things we will face down there, but we had best come prepared.~
@40346=~I don't even know all the names of those creatures. You're going to have to fill me in on the way. I don't want to get caught off-guard.~
@40347=~I appreciate it. Hopefully I won't be too much dead weight in the dark.~
@40348=~You are? That's good to hear.~
@40349=~It's a grim sight. I've heard stories about the Great Oak... I never thought I'd see it like this.~
@40350=~Yes... it is awful what they are doing to the tree.~
@40351=~The most we can do now is defeat all these yuan-ti that are attacking it. It will be up to the druids of Kuldahar to heal the tree when the war is over.~
@40352=~We have a lot of work to do, then.~
@40353=~I'm not a druid, and this harm probably pains Iselore more than it does me, but still... we should do something about it.~
@40354=~Hells, I've never felt this warm before. How does anything live here?~
@40355=~The Mezro have been living here just as long as your ancestors have lived in Icewind Dale. If anything, it should be amazing that anything lives in Targos. How many people have died of the cold back home?~
@40356=~Let's try and stay in the shade. Maybe the heat will be more bearable.~
@40357=~You'd be surprised at where life can live. If it can live in the Gloomfrost and the deserts of Anauroch, it can live in Chult.~
@40358=~Not many normally, as long as we keep a fire going at home. The Ten Towns, unlike Luskan, don't venerate Auril, so we don't go out of our way to stay in the cold. It's definitely a threat for us soldiers and adventurers, though.~
@40359=~I miss home. I've been away for too long. Eh, forget it. We've got snakes to kill.~
@40360=~So this is where it ends. Slaves, demons in the halls, and gods know what that sickly growth all over the walls is. And this used to be an elven fortress?... I never realized just how far the horde reached.~
@40361=~Almost every corner of Icewind Dale, it seems.~
@40362=~I'm cold and tired and angry. I can't wait to put the twins' heads on a pike.~
@40363=~What are your plans for when this is all over?~
@40364=~I'm very curious about that growth on the walls. I've never seen it before.~
@40365=~I'm starting to wonder if this was all avoidable. The Legion wasn't just goblins and orcs starting a bigger raid; the cambions recruited beings all over Icewind Dale, and even far down south. How did they unite so many people?~
@40366=~Raising an army takes money, and allies. Isair and Madae said they were there to unite the freaks and half-breeds of the world. They couldn't have bribed the whole army into fighting for them.~
@40367=~What are you getting at?~
@40368=~True. Plunder alone couldn't have financed this; the Legion arose too suddenly and too unexpectedly to just be an outgrowing of a bigger goblin tribe.~
@40369=~You can't raise a horde against humankind if humankind didn't already have a horde's worth of enemies. I don't regret putting Torak to the sword or cutting down those cultists at the ice wall or fighting those snakes in the jungle. Those were evil beings fighting for evil causes.~
@40370=~But it's the other cases that make me wonder. All those yuan-ti half-breeds in Dragon's Eye... They were half-human. Why did they have to be on the side of the yuan-ti, instead of siding with the humans?~
@40371=~Humans didn't want them.~
@40372=~They were raised among yuan-ti. Of course they'd side with the ones who raised them.~
@40373=~So what do humans do after this? Do we want them now, after the war is over? Or do they run away and come back to fight again?~
@40374=~You've been thinking about this.~
@40375=~I don't know. We might see another war, I suppose.~
@40376=~I don't think we'll be leaving many alive, honestly.~
@40377=~I have. I don't normally, but I have. Everything is so complicated now.~
@40378=~I'm so tired of the fighting. There are just so many of them to fight, and we've lost so many of our own.~
@40379=~They're not all going to go away. But I don't know how to make peace after all this. I'm not a diplomat; I'm just another soldier. And I don't know who *will* fix everything. I hope this will end when the twins are dead. But I wouldn't count on it.~
@40380=~What about you? Think we're going to see an end to the war? Gods, I sound like some pompous scholar sitting at home in his armchair, thinking he understands the world outside his door...~
@40381=~Wars end when the enemy is dead. We can't kill them all just yet, but we'll get closer. And they'll definitely know better than to attack us again.~
@40382=~I don't think these wars do end. All you can do is stop them temporarily. We'll have to be content with that.~
@40383=~I haven't thought about it. Too busy killing monsters. I'm used to it, honestly.~
@40384=~Armchair philosophers spend their lives pondering the history we make.~
@40385=~I don't really mind if the war starts again. I've enjoyed our long string of victories. Sure, the road is hell, but we've gotten stronger and richer and smarter than we'd ever be back home, and we've seen things lesser people only dream of. Maybe I'll spend the next war as a general instead of a foot soldier.~
@40386=~I think I'll sit the next war out. It's about time I retired.~
@40387=~We probably have a lot of peacemaking ahead of us. It'll be a nice change from the bloodshed.~
@40388=~I'm not sticking around to find out. As soon as this is over, I'm heading south.~
@40389=~I hope so. I don't like this war, but if we're going to have it, I want my side to win.~
@40390=~Let's get going, then. We have devils to kill.~
@40391=~I'll try. Come on, let's go find the twins. It's time they answered for the war they started.~
@40392=~Heh. I felt so angry and helpless when we first met on the docks. Now I have a hundred battles to my name, and more kills than I can count. I don't even notice the smell of blood anymore.~
@40393=~All right, enough musing. We have work to do. Let's see where the cambions have been hiding.~
@40394=~I wonder what the historians will say about us. The songs will probably say I was ten feet high and could breathe fire, if they remember us at all.~
@40395=~Doesn't matter now. All that matters is finding Isair and Madae.~
@40396=~Not far from the truth. Come on, let's go inspire some tall tales.~
@40397=~Right. Let's get to it. I can't wait to find out what cambion blood smells like.~
@40398=~And butcher some half-devil freaks.~
@40399=~Must be nice to bark orders from a tidy office and let the grunts do the dirty work. Maybe I'll take over from Shawford. Ulbrec could hardly say no; I've served Targos more than anyone by this point.~
@40400=~I've fought enough to last ten lifetimes by now. And made enough gold to last fifty... maybe I'll buy up some land and make myself into a lord somewhere.~
@40401=~I wouldn't even know where to start. I'm just a soldier. I think I'll have to leave that to the diplomats.~
@40402=~Until then, we have work to do. Let's go hunt down the twins. It's time we ended this.~
@40403=~I don't blame you. I wouldn't mind visiting someplace warmer. Besides, I guess I'm an adventurer now. There's no future for me at Targos. I'm going back home after this, but I don't think I'll stay there for long.~
@40404=~Eh, we can figure that out later. It won't be much longer. We're almost there.~
@40405=~Likewise. And I hope they suffer when we put them down. I want those self-righteous devils to feel the pain we have.~
@40406=~Let's get to it, then. Better find them before they find us.~
@40407=~I don't even know. I'm a soldier still, just like that day at the docks. But I'm not the same kind of soldier as my fellows back home.~
@40408=~I feel like nothing else in life will compare to the past few weeks. We've lived ten lifetimes on the road to this tower. I don't know what happens after this.~
@40409=~Half the things I've seen since I joined this group are things I've never seen before. I don't even blink at it anymore. Every day, we run into something I didn't even know existed.~
@40410=~When asked about his past, Xhaan reveals that he was one of the baatezu released upon this plane when the archmage Arakon opened a portal to the Nine Hells. Xhaan and his platoon of white abishai were gaining prestige among their superiors. They hoped that by capturing souls from the Material Plane and bringing them back to Baator, they would earn their promotion to a higher form of abishai. However, they were quickly overwhelmed by barbarians. In the chaos of the battle, they had to escape into the mountains rather than back into the portal. After Jerrod closed the portal, Xhaan and his abishai were stranded in the Material Plane.

After a few days of traveling, Xhaan's band came across the half-dragon Sherincal, who promised them a spot in the Legion of the Chimera. This legion was led by half-devils, she said, and Xhaan's band joined, hoping to eventually get the promotions they deserved. But instead, they got imprisoned in the Ice Temple and used as tools in Lysara's ritual.

Xhaan seeks revenge on the Legion of the Chimera for this insult. However, you sense that promotion is still of greater importance to him than revenge. He would likely betray you if a greater devil decreed that was necessary for his promotion.

Since Xhaan was not summoned by conventional magic, there is no time limit to his stay on this plane. Dismissal and Banishment spells will not work on him.~
@40411=~HAH! Bet that'll put the scare in the little green freaks! Let's see if they're daft enough to try the walls again. Heh... I'm *almost* glad you dragged me up here. I wonder how much gold we can dig out of their pockets...~
@40412=~Ever the graverobber, Geoffrey. Hey, don't forget our share-you're not the only one who earned another notch on their belt today.~
@40413=~Glad you can carry your weight, "adventurer." Let's go report to Shawford and Ulbrec.~
@40414=~You're a bloodthirsty man, Black Geoffrey. I think I'll keep you around.~
@40415=~Glad? We nearly died!~
@40416=~Let's get out of here... The stench is unbearable.~
@40417=~Hmph. You want gold, take it yourself-or beg that old crow for some spare coin. I wasn't splitting goblins like cordwood for your benefit.~
@40418=~I'm no one's attack dog, <PRO_BOYGIRL>. *Never* forget that.~
@40419=~Best you learn fast, whelp. Or keep your scrawny neck out of combat, before a better fighter decides to split it open for you. Weak men don't live long on the battlefield.~
@40420=~Go on yourself; I'm not done here. Maybe one of these goblins can buy me something better than that watery swill that Gohar's been selling us...~
@40421=~boy~
@40422=~girl~
@40423=~Boy~
@40424=~Girl~
@40425=~Now THAT's a wage! Had I known Shawford would give this much pay, I sure wouldn't have lollygagged in that tavern for so long. Didn't realize the city had all this gold to spare. From what I heard, Targos was too deep in debt even to buy arrows.~
@40426=~And it's only a fraction of the gold we've already earned! You're in the right party.~
@40427=~Aye, this is an impressive amount.~
@40428=~It's not much. A single enchanted item will likely cost thousands more.~
@40429=~What about those two mercenaries you were working with before? Will you rejoin them now?~
@40430=~It's still far more than the zero gold I had earned in this city prior to this. Legally, anyway.~
@40431=~Legally? What did you do that was illegal?~
@40432=~What sorts of illegal things did you do in Targos? Just curious.~
@40433=~Let's get going, then.~
@40434=~Don't you dare ask. I won't have you rat me out to the guards.~
@40435=~Eh, forget about them. I only knew them for about a tenday. I'm moving on to this group for now.~
@40436=~How do we know you won't abandon us the way you did them?~
@40437=~Aye, let's move on.~
@40438=~You don't. I might do that. But the way things are looking, it's getting less likely. Better hope the pay stays this good.~
@40439=~I don't like it. Whole damn forest is crawling with orcs. Look away half a second and we could get an arrow through the neck...~
@40440=~Oh, are you losing your nerve, Geoffrey? I thought you were some battle-hardened veteran. I must have been mistaken...~
@40441=~Ah, the good old arrow to the neck! Quick and clean. Definitely the best way to die.~
@40442=~Same's true for the orcs. They wander off to take a piss and then *thwip*-choking on their own blood!~
@40443=~We should be careful where we set up camp. Hopefully if the orcs see our fire, they'll assume it's one of theirs.~
@40444=~Shut your mouth before I break your teeth in, <PRO_BOYGIRL>. A veteran's smart enough to look for danger out in the field... Keep your eyes open. If you get yourself killed, *I* better not be the one who has to bury your corpse.~
@40445=~Never thought you'd have the courtesy to bury me, Geoffrey.~
@40446=~Just a friendly jest, brother. No need to lose your temper.~
@40447=~I hope that's not the only reason you want me to survive.~
@40448=~It's not *courtesy,* fool. You bury your dead so the enemy can't find it! Else you'll leave clues for the orcs to hunt down.~
@40449=~Touching. I'll keep that in mind.~
@40450=~Why not burn it instead?~
@40451=~You've never smelled burning flesh, eh? Trust me, a body makes poor kindling...~
@40452=~I'm not your brother <PRO_BOYGIRL>. And keep your "friendly jests" to yourself.~
@40453=~What, do you think I should treasure your personality? We're *blades,* friend. We shed blood and earn gold, and that's it. Don't expect any more from me.~
@40454=~Shut up, <PRO_BOYGIRL>; you're no clever court jester. Just keep your eyes open. If you get yourself killed, *I* better not be the one who has to bury your corpse.~
@40455=~Better not miss. If he runs back to his camp, he'll bring his friends with him.~
@40456=~From what I've heard, orcs don't value archers as highly as they value brawny axe fighters. The archers are typically the weaklings of their kind.~
@40457=~Orcs are strong in general. I bet even the weaker ones can shoot an arrow pretty hard.~
@40458=~Moonblade, eh? Sounds like a rare treat... Not something you could get from Deirdre, or even Ulbrec's wench. You think we could-heh-make better use of that blade than that little priest girl?~
@40459=~You saw her fight. You want to be on her bad side, you're on your own.~
@40460=~Best not anger the gods, Geoffrey. You wouldn't be the first insolent mortal to get himself killed for a few short words of blasphemy.~
@40461=~Let's see how special that blade really is before we bother. Wouldn't be the first time I saw a magic sword turn out to be a shiny knife.~
@40462=~Are you asking me to betray one of my sister priests, Geoffrey?~
@40463=~Aye, I did see her. And I wasn't impressed-not with her fighting, anyway. Afraid of a lonely priest girl without any sword? Hah!~
@40464=~Come off it, Geoffrey. The answer is no.~
@40465=~Spoken like a man who doesn't know magic. Never underestimate a stranger... Some people don't need swords to fight.~
@40466=~There's hardly a god across the planes I haven't angered, and I'm still here. I'm just saying, don't let a good opportunity pass you by...~
@40467=~Just a thought to chew on... Can't hurt to have a better blade.~
@40468=~About time we put down that dog... Damn barking could make my ears bleed.~
@40469=~By the hells, the *stink* of that beast! I heard about these river trolls somewhere... Spend their whole lives in the water, they say. 'Course the thing reeks; it's been pickling for years.~
@40470=~It might actually be that strange growth on its skin. I don't believe that's typical for any troll.~
@40471=~Let's get out of here before the whole cave stinks of it.~
@40472=~Whatever. Damn thing's dead now, and that's all that matters.~
@40473=~Do we really have to travel with this creature? The stench is worse than dead fish.~
@40474=~Still better than yours.~
@40475=~We'll get used to it eventually.~
@40476=~Just wait. It'll be worth it when Vrek's ripping goblins in half for us.~
@40477=~A sharp tongue's no good when it's cut out of your throat. Don't test me, <PRO_BOYGIRL>.~
@40478=~You better be right. Just don't expect me to set up camp with that thing around.~
@40479=~Hm. I'll believe it when I see it.~
@40480=~Ah, now here it is. The blade that little priest girl wanted so badly. Let's give it a few swings and see how much it hurts...~
@40481=~*Remain silent*~
@40482=~The moonblade is not for you! We are returning it to Emma.~
@40483=~Don't touch the moonblade! It will burn your hands if you try to hold it!~
@40484=~AGHH! Even the handle is burning hot! How did that priest wench use it without killing herself?~
@40485=~Clearly some people can hold it without burning themselves. I assume Emma can.~
@40486=~Let me try holding it.~
@40487=~*Actually*, <PRO_BOYGIRL>, we only give it back if I don't want it myself. Trying it now...~
@40488=~Really? It doesn't feel hot from here. I'll grip it just to be sure...~
@40489=~AGHH! You're right; it *is* hot! How did that priest wench use it without killing herself?~
@40490=~It does not burn followers of Selune or other good folk.~
@40491=~Then we may as well sell it. At least one merchant will fork over some gold for it.~
@40492=~We're not selling it; we're bringing it back to Emma.~
@40493=~We'll see how much it's worth when we get to that point.~
@40494=~Emma had better pay for it.~
@40495=~Wait, it doesn't burn you? It might be worth more than I thought a few seconds ago.~
@40496=~We're not selling it; I'm going to wield it myself.~
@40497=~See? It doesn't look like it's hot, but it hurts like hell! We may as well sell it. At least one merchant will fork over some gold for it.~
@40498=~What're you squinting at, wench? See something you like? Or are you just trying to annoy me?~
@40499=~Even if it weren't for that gruesome scowl on your face, I can sense the darkness behind your eyes. How is it that an evil man like you ended up fighting for Targos?~
@40500=~Blood and coin and ale. Does that *offend* you, miss priest? Were you hoping for something more? Heh... We're here to kill. If you don't like it, run off and leave the men to do their dirty work.~
@40501=~I am not surprised. But no, Geoffrey, I am not running off. There is too much work to be done.~
@40502=~I hope this is not the kind of man you normally befriend. I'll tolerate his presence if we are fighting on the same side, but a cutthroat is not someone you can trust when times are dire and our luck goes bad.~
@40503=~He's a sword arm. As far as I'm concerned, that's all he needs to be.~
@40504=~You'll need a tough stomach if you're going to fight for Targos, Emma. The enemy is far darker than Geoffrey.~
@40505=~Times are already dire, Emma. There were a lot of good men in Targos we could have traveled with, men you might have trusted more. But those men died when the goblins attacked. We did not choose the friends we wanted. We chose the friends who survived.~
@40506=~Very true. And maybe we'll part ways with him at some point. But that's a decision for another day.~
@40507=~I hope that's true. But a traveling companion is more than just a sword-they must also be your *shield.* I know I am new to the group, and I do not expect things to change on my advice alone, but I would feel remiss if I didn't speak up. I will only say this, and leave the decision to your judgment: ask yourself not who you believe can defeat your enemies, but who you trust to keep you safe.~
@40508=~I will, Emma. And I appreciate your advice.~
@40509=~Honestly, Emma, I do not expect anyone to keep me safe. I don't expect to live much longer. I only intend to fight for as long as I can.~
@40510=~Perhaps now I have both. If Geoffrey is my sword, will you be my shield, Emma?~
@40511=~Noble intentions. I admire them-I suppose I feel the same way about my own duties; mine is also the life of service. But if Targos needs you, remember that it needs you alive. Perhaps for a very long time.~
@40512=~Good point. I'll try not to get myself killed before my work is done.~
@40513=~And perhaps you can help me survive that long.~
@40514=~I thank you. And if you are in need, don't hesitant to call for my aid. I would be glad to help a new friend.~
@40515=~And if we're lucky, maybe someday I'll be an old friend.~
@40516=~I appreciate it, Emma. I will.~
@40517=~I shall. You have my word.~
@40518=~I have no doubt. But a traveling companion is more than just a sword-they must also be your *shield.* I know I am new to the group, and I do not expect things to change on my advice alone, but I would feel remiss if I didn't speak up. I will only say this, and leave the decision to your judgment: ask yourself not who you believe can defeat your enemies, but who you trust to keep you safe.~
@40519=~I am sorry to hear that, and I understand the need to find allies where you can. I will respect the choices you've made. I do believe, though, that a traveling companion is more than just a sword-they must also be your *shield.*~
@40520=~Very true. And I appreciate your advice.~
@40521=~We should make that decision soon. But I will leave it up to you.~
@40522=~Ech... I don't like this. Not one damn bit.~
@40523=~What do you mean?~
@40524=~Keep your whining to yourself, Geoffrey.~
@40525=~We're alive, aren't we?~
@40526=~The goblins and orcs I can handle. The odd wild animal doesn't bother me, either. Even the damn *bugbears* I don't mind; it's just a bigger kind of beast.~
@40527=~*spits* Not a complaint, <PRO_BOYGIRL>. An omen. We signed up to fight off goblins and orcs. But this? This is different.~
@40528=~Aye, and what's it gotten us? We earned some coin, sure-more than I've ever had before, I think-but look at where we are, <PRO_BOYGIRL>. Out in the middle of the wilderness, no one to watch our backs... A whole army in front of us, and not just goblins anymore.~
@40529=~Shawford's given us the support he can. Targos still needs men back home, and there aren't as many of them as there used to be.~
@40530=~So? We faced an army at the bridge, too, and here we stand.~
@40531=~You thinking of calling it quits? Heading back to Cormyr?~
@40532=~Don't lose your nerve now, friend. We've got a long ways to go.~
@40533=~Don't remind me... whole town's doomed, I figure, and here we are, fighting for a lord that's probably going to end up with his head on some goblin's pike 'fore the end of the year.~
@40534=~Even the bridge wasn't like this... The goblins and orcs I can handle. The odd wild animal doesn't bother me, either. Even the damn *bugbears* I don't mind; it's just a bigger kind of beast.~
@40535=~Well, what in the hells are we doing out here? You saw the magic that yellow-eyed pig was spouting before we put it down, and I bet the *inside* of the fortress has even worse. Listen... The goblins and orcs I can handle. The odd wild animal doesn't bother me, either. Even the damn *bugbears* I don't mind; it's just a bigger kind of beast.~
@40536=~Ain't a matter of nerve, "friend." Stop and think for a second. You really think that old bundle of sticks around Targos is going to hold out forever? Whole town's doomed, I figure, and here we are, fighting for a lord that's probably going to end up with his head on some goblin's pike 'fore the end of the year.~
@40537=~But look at the battlefield. Aye, we won this fight, but look at what we had to kill. We're not just outnumbered, <PRO_BOYGIRL>... The horde has magic, *strong* magic, and not just a few demented shamans drunk off of mead or braehg or tree sap toddy.~
@40538=~That yellow-eyed orc was screaming at the sky to call down the thunder on us... I can still hear the rumble. Rare magic, that. Even the air is still buzzing. Big magic, big numbers, drums, and *worgs*-by the hells, what if a fight goes sour and we have to hoof it back to the woods? We can't outrun a pack of worgs on our tails.~
@40539=~*spits* We signed up to fight goblins. Not this.~
@40540=~If you don't have the stones for the job, tuck your tail between your legs and bugger off... and leave the work to the real men.~
@40541=~Ha! Be a man, Geoffrey. If I can handle it, so can you.~
@40542=~Personally, I find it exciting. Where else can we get entertainment like this?~
@40543=~Maybe so. But why do you think the horde *has* magic like this? Gold. Powerful wizards don't work for free. Inside that fortress is more coin than we could ever get out of Shawford, I bet.~
@40544=~Bet you feel pretty stupid now, huh?~
@40545=~You and I have been neck-deep in blood since the day at the palisade. You think a few decrepit old shamans are going to stop us now? Ha! Look at the top of that fortress, Geoffrey-you and I? We're going to be right at the top soon enough, looking down on all of this, and if there's a single goblin still breathing when we're done, it's going to be bowing at our feet and worshipping us as kings.~
@40546=~Say that again, I *dare* you, you mangy cur! You think I'm afraid of this place? I'm the only reason you even made it this far. *snort* Let's get going... my sword arm needs some work.~
@40547=~Piss off, wench. You don't know what you're getting yourself into-not with this horde, and not with me.~
@40548=~Whatever. Are you done now? We've still got work to do.~
@40549=~I know the danger, Geoffrey. We're into the belly of the beast now. Sooner we get in, the sooner we cut our way out, eh?~
@40550=~Let's just get going.~
@40551=~Fine. But watch that mouth of yours. I'm not above beating some sense into a woman who steps out of line.~
@40552=~You will regret that if you try it.~
@40553=~Fine. Let's get this over with. Just don't blame me when the orcs are roasting your sorry carcasse alive.~
@40554=~Any tavern with a cheap wench and a half-drunk bard. That's all I want right now. A soft girl and a stiff drink.~
@40555=~Then let's get going. We'll want to have a grand tale to tell the girl, won't we?~
@40556=~Also a good choice. But it will have to wait-we've got more work to do.~
@40557=~Or vice versa, depending on your tastes.~
@40558=~They'll still be there when we get back. Shall we get going?~
@40559=~Fine. Let's get walking; my toes are getting numb just standing here in the snow.~
@40560=~Aye, and you're the fool who's dumb enough to enjoy it all, too. We'll see how long that smile lasts when the orcs are roasting you over a spit.~
@40561=~Hm. Aye. Aye, I like the sound of that.~
@40562=~I thought you might. Come on, let's inspire some tall tales.~
@40563=~You have good taste, my friend. Forward!~
@40564=~See you in the Hells, blue-skinned bitch.~
@40565=~I *never* should have come here. Never should have signed on, never should have came to Targos, never should have let you drag me to the palisade! I should split that gnome in two! And Ulbrec, too. Damn fool put his best fighters in a rickety ship and sent us off to die! By the hells... how are we going to get home? Or anywhere?~
@40566=~- I have never been so far from Donovan -
- lost in another sea -
- an ocean of snow -~
@40567=~My head is still spinning from the crash... I'm amazed we're still alive. But what are we supposed to do now?~
@40568=~Vrek not understand. Ship supposed to land soft. Now we stuck. Gnome trick us? Or gnome stupid?~
@40569=~I did not know Oswald, but I am disappointed nonetheless. The airship was a foolish choice, and now all of us have to pay the price. I am not certain how to proceed... this is not safe territory, nor one we have prepared for.~
@40570=~I thought I was on the winning team. I didn't realize how stupid you townies really are-or how stupid I was to join. But no, I walked right onto an untested machine, just on your say-so, and now here we are. Doomed to starve, because that daft gnome told us a tall tale and we believed him.~
@40571=~I'm not sure how much I blame Oswald. Those priests atop the wall caused the crash, and that wasn't something any of us could have foreseen.~
@40572=~Oswald almost got us all killed. I can't believe I expected that thing to stay in the air... But here we are. Too late to go back now.~
@40573=~Oswald almost got us all killed. I can't believe I expected that thing to stay in the air... But here we are. Too late to go back now. I guess now we just have to... improvise.~
@40574=~Let's just stay focused. The ship could still make a decent shelter, and if we do some scouting, or get that ship back up in the air, we might be able to continue the mission.~
@40575=~I think we might be doomed.~
@40576=~Who were those priests atop the wall? Why is the wall even here?~
@40577=~The whole point of going in the air is so that we *wouldn't* run into the enemy! Excuses be damned, Ulbrec threw us out into the cold! If I ever get back to Targos...~
@40578=~I hope you're not suggesting you'd try to attack the lord of Targos, Geoffrey.~
@40579=~Conserve your energy. We'll need it if we're going to survive at all. We should start scouting.~
@40580=~I think I'd rather have Ulbrec alive, so he could still pay us.~
@40581=~Fair point. But I suppose it's moot now.~
@40582=~Don't you dare lecture me, <PRO_BOYGIRL>! Not now! Not when we're lost and alone! I've damn good reason to be angry, whelp, and Ulbrec's not here to complain-so you can keep your mouth shut... until you can get back to Targos and lick his boot.~
@40583=~Don't test *my* patience, either, Geoffrey. Look, we've got work to do.~
@40584=~Fine. You're not worth talking to, anyway.~
@40585=~I won't suffer a threat to Ulbrec, mercenary. Watch your words.~
@40586=~Fine. 'Sides, I don't want to stand here all day.~
@40587=~Aye. Aye, we're owed a dragon's hoard for a job like this. If we ever make it out of this.~
@40588=~Ah, the lapdog is trying to bark. Keep it up, <PRO_BOYGIRL>. I bet your master will be very happy with you... if we ever back it back.~
@40589=~*spits* Aye. May as well do some scouting. If we're going to set up camp in that pile of splinters, best we make sure we're not ten feet from a wolf's den.~
@40590=~Aye, the mission! How could I forget? The whole reason we're knee-deep in snow in the first place. By all *means,* <PRO_BOYGIRL>, lead the way.~
@40591=~I don't appreciate the sarcasm. Back of the line, and keep your mouth shut.~
@40592=~No mission means no coin, friend. We've been paid well so far, and there's more to come when we're done.~
@40593=~Whatever, Geoffrey.~
@40594=~The gnome's lost half his mind, but he's not the only one I blame for this. Ulbrec was just as stupid to put our safety into the airship. *Never* make excuses for a bad leader, <PRO_RACE>. My clan would put a dagger in my neck if I ever sent them on a mission like this.~
@40595=~Never mind. We need to focus on the task at hand. Let's go scouting and get our bearings. We'll want to make sure we're in a safe place before we set up camp.~
@40596=~Would you put a dagger in *my* neck if you were displeased with my leadership, goblin?~
@40597=~This isn't your clan and we don't follow goblin customs. You should adjust to that.~
@40598=~I'm not making excuses. If Ulbrec had any reason to expect a giant wall of ice suddenly rising up in the pass, I would fault him, but this was unforeseeable.~
@40599=~I wonder what human society would look like if we got rid of our leaders like that?~
@40600=~Right. No sense arguing over the past. We've got work to do.~
@40601=~I would, yes. And if I were leading the party, I'd expect you to do the same to me. A clan is only as strong as the brain that leads it.~
@40602=~Bold words, goblin. Too bold, to be honest.~
@40603=~Perhaps. But a dagger in the neck is a poor way to solve a problem.~
@40604=~You can try to slit my throat, goblin. But I wouldn't recommend it.~
@40605=~Ha! Fine. Let's get to work, then. We got scouting to do.~
@40606=~All right, I'll keep my mouth shut.~
@40607=~Very quick, though.~
@40608=~Not a threat; just a statement of principle.~
@40609=~Fine. I'm not here to argue.~
@40610=~Good point. It's definitely not a natural occurrence. Not good news. It would take strong magic to erect a wall like that, stronger than I've ever seen... or heard of, really.~
@40611=~Speaking of which, we'd best investigate it. Make sure we understand what's really in front of us.~
@40612=~No doubt it has something to do with the horde. I don't see who else would benefit from the wall, or who would have the resources to erect it.~
@40613=~We best be careful. If the people who caused the crash find out we're still alive, they might want to finish the job.~
@40614=~I wish I could tell you more. But my superiors in the horde didn't share many secrets. We're going to be in the dark for a while longer.~
@40615=~Probably like goblin society. Depends on whether you think that's good or bad.~
@40616=~That is true. The airship might have fallen, but it took strong magic to do so-the same magic that built a wall of ice high enough to block the pass.~
@40617=~Any idea what kind of magic? I assume it has something to do with the horde. I don't see who else would benefit from the wall, or who would have the resources to erect it.~
@40618=~It's not a reassuring sign.~
@40619=~We best be careful. If the people who caused the crash find out we're still alive, they might want to finish the job.~
@40620=~It would not surprise me. Divine magic, I'm sure, and I suspect Auril is responsible. But I do not know the nature of her relationship with the horde. Auril has worshippers among the local barbarians-I know that much of the area-but her only connection to goblinoid clans that I can think of is that both are of evil intent.~
@40621=~That might be the only connection that was necessary. We already know the horde is a coalition. An alliance with Auril would be just another string in a very wide web. Not surprising, really...~
@40622=~Then maybe they aren't connected?~
@40623=~Well, there's only one way to find out. Maybe we can do some skulking around the ice wall and pick up a few clues.~
@40624=~Perhaps. I suppose we'll find the truth soon enough.~
@40625=~It's possible. Unfortunately, I doubt it would make the wall any easier for us to pass, if it were only an Aurilite invention. We are the enemies of Auril as much as we are the enemies of the horde. I can only pray that the wall is not as impenetrable as it seems.~
@40626=~I would urge caution. I do not think they would appreciate our investigations any more than they appreciated Oswald's airship.~
@40627=~No, but I would not despair. We are alive, hale, and so far, I see no priests of Auril hunting for survivors. If they assumed us dead, that gives us time to act and explore before our presence is detected. Come; we should make the most of the time we have.~
@40628=~A giant wall before us, no clear path back to Targos, and no ship to carry us anywhere... I don't think we're going to reach the Neverwinter forces. Should we try to get past that wall? Or just sit tight and try to survive for now?~
@40629=~We can make that decision after we've done some scouting. I want to know what we're really dealing with here.~
@40630=~Surviving out here shouldn't be too difficult. I've done it in worse conditions. We've got a store of supplies in the ship, some local beetles if we can't find other sources of food, and the remains of the ship can make a decent enough shelter.~
@40631=~Sooner or later, we'll have to deal with the wall. I don't think scaling the mountains around us is going to get us anywhere, and we can't live here forever.~
@40632=~Maybe the ship can still be repaired... and maybe we can get it out of here without it getting knocked down again. But that could take time.~
@40633=~That's reassuring. I wasn't looking forward to starving to death. Never eaten a giant beetle, though.~
@40634=~Honestly, they're not great. Hopefully we'll find something a little more palatable.~
@40635=~Finding food isn't the real danger, I think. It's those priests at the wall... But Reig, you should really rest your head. One concussion raises the risk of another concussion, and that can mean long-term damage if you rattle your head again.~
@40636=~I'll be careful, but I'm not going to lie down in the airship with Oswald while you're out here. I couldn't live with myself if I was asleep when my comrades were in danger.~
@40637=~Then we'd better get started. Lead the way.~
@40638=~I'm glad you share my confidence. Well, if we *are* doomed, we'll have plenty of time to die later. Right now we need to scout out the area and make sure this is a safe place to set up camp. We're in unfamiliar territory, and the beetles might not be the only threat... or the only source of food.~
@40639=~Food?~
@40640=~Can't hurt to explore our options. Let's go.~
@40641=~Good point. Here's hoping those priests think we died in the crash. I'd rather not have a search party coming after us.~
@40642=~Beetles are perfectly good food, townie. You just need to know how to cook them.~
@40643=~And how do we do that?~
@40644=~You can eat beetles all you like. I'm going to look for some real food.~
@40645=~The trick is to hold your nose.~
@40646=~No need to despair just yet. Despite the crash, we are alive and hale. And so far, I see no priests of Auril hunting for survivors. If they assumed us dead, that gives us time to act and explore before our presence is detected. Come; we should make the most of the time we have.~
@40647=~I don't know, but it's probably the horde's work. Who else could it be?~
@40648=~It's like the horde knows every evil group in Icewind Dale, down to the tiniest goblin clan.~
@40649=~Makes sense. A sealed pass is definitely bad for the Ten Towns.~
@40650=~Yeah, but those priests were humans. What would humans be doing working for the horde?~
@40651=~I guess we've got more work to do before we can meet the Neverwinter forces. That wall's standing in the way. We've got to find *some* way of getting past it. I'm ready when you are.~
@40652=~Gold, I bet. It hardly matters. Human or goblin or faerie or devil, they made themselves the enemy. Let's go find them.~
@40653=~I suspect they were priests of Auril. But if they are, I do not know the true nature of Auril's relationship with the horde. Auril has worshippers among the local barbarians-I know that much of the area-but her only connection to goblinoid clans that I can think of is that both are of evil intent.~
@40654=~It must be connected to the horde. Sealing off the pass is a strong blow against the Ten Towns. It's what I would do, if I were the horde.~
@40655=~Did you hear anything about the pass when you were with the horde? Or anything about a group of priests?~
@40656=~I guess so. How do we even deal with this thing?~
@40657=~Perfect. We're stuck here and Ulbrec has no way of knowing we need help.~
@40658=~I wish I could tell you more. But my superiors in the horde didn't share many secrets. I don't think we'll know unless we investigate the wall. That will be tricky. If those priests could bring down the airship, they can probably do the same to us. Be careful. Eyes could be anywhere.~
@40659=~Hard to say. We need more information. But investigating the wall will be dangerous. If those priests could bring down the airship, they can probably do the same to us. We should be discreet. Eyes could be anywhere.~
@40660=~I guess we're on our own for now. We'd better explore the territory and make sure the airship is a safe campsite. But if we're going to get any further, we're going to have to approach the wall. That will be tricky. If those priests could bring down the airship, they can probably do the same to us. Be careful. Eyes could be anywhere.~
@40661=~- We have chosen strength over humanity -
 - Do we still protect the weak -
 - Or do we feed the beast now -~
@40662=~Sometimes protecting the weak means feeding the beast. It's not kind words that kill goblins. It's steel.~
@40663=~No offense, Veira, but the rest of us still have lives to lose. I'm not taking chances with mine. I'd rather live with a troll than die to an orc.~
@40664=~Our goals haven't changed. Don't worry; we're still committed to protecting Targos.~
@40665=~This didn't really go the way I planned, to be honest. But I'm not sure we can go back.~
@40666=~- How long will it join us -
 - How long will we feed it -
 - And will it turn on us in the end -~
@40667=~- I do not know what life you see -
 - I hope that it will end in old age -
 - And now in the claws of a monster -~
@40668=~- A novel sight -
 - A beast walking alongside heroes -
 - In the town I call home -~
@40669=~- So little time to think -
 - Only to react -
 - And pray that our choices were wise -~
@40670=~- So many people torn from their homes -
 - Even when they return to their beds -
 - The memories will surface in their nightmares -~
@40671=~You're a bit of a downer, aren't you, Veira?~
@40672=~We've saved many lives today. That's supposed to be good news.~
@40673=~They'll tough it out. Come on; we've still got a job to do.~
@40674=~- I can see it in their eyes -
 - The fear behind the relief -
 - How close they came to the end -~
@40675=~- It's true -
 - We've done well -
 - But there are wounds we cannot cure -
 - And pains we cannot soothe -~
@40676=~- More lost husbands -
 - The war does not end -
 - Their sons will fight the same battle -
 - And their families left behind -~
@40677=~Hm. It's a grim sentiment. I'd like to think that the war will end eventually. And that we're doing something to get the world closer to that day.~
@40678=~I try not to think about it.~
@40679=~What's it like being a ghost, Veira?~
@40680=~There's not much of an alternative. If the soldiers don't defend Targos from the horde, the goblins will kill their families, too.~
@40681=~- Long after we are gone -
 - The sun will rise on a new world -
 - Gray with the ashes of death -
 - But perhaps still blooming with life -~
@40682=~- A hard task -
 - Persistent as the tide and deep as any ocean -
 - Are we not all haunted by our thoughts -~
@40683=~- A vague shadow of life -
 - Every sensation is weak and distant -
 - When a flower holds no scent and the wind is all but silent -
 - Only sorrow retains its edge -~
@40684=~- Which is better -
 - To be slain every generation -
 - Or to be slain only once -
 - And then rest -~
@40685=~- You are not alone -
 - There is no sorrow like a partner's absence -
 - We shall do our best to find him -~
@40686=~I'm curious why a ghost is with us.~
@40687=~- I am here to shepherd the living -
 - To be their shield -
 - My only task left -
 - And then fade away -~
@40688=~I assume you died when the goblins attacked?~
@40689=~- I left this world before then -
 - My husband lost at sea -
 - His wife left to wait -
 - Until she could wait no longer -~
@40690=~My condolences. Am I also under your aegis, since I'm fighting for Targos now?~
@40691=~- So long as you are with us -
 - I will keep you safe -~
@40692=~And it doesn't bother you that I was working with the horde?~
@40693=~- I do have reservations -
 - I know what you are inside -
 - Cold and black and twisted -~
@40694=~- But I do not foresee betrayal -
 - I only see a mercenary -
 - One among many -~
@40695=~Cold, black, twisted, and yet still trustworthy. Yes, that sounds like me.~
@40696=~You can stop staring at me when you think I'm not looking. If I wanted to plant an axe in your skull, I'd have already done it.~
@40697=~Aye, and the second you change your mind, you'd try it anyway, wouldn't you? Who's to say you won't get cold feet when a fight goes south, and start thinking about whose side you're really on?~
@40698=~We could ask you the same question. You're as much a mercenary as I am.~
@40699=~I'm an *adventurer,* goblin. But you? You're just a thieving runt the horde dragged up out of the mud.~
@40700=~Me? A RUNT!? I'm the biggest and strongest of my tribe! I would beat a goblin to death if they told me what you just said. And I would do the same if they were a bugbear. You *better* not call me that again.~
@40701=~Argh, fine. But I still don't like this.~
@40702=~You're a fool to trust a goblin, <PRO_BOYGIRL>. Even if he doesn't try to slit our throats in our sleep, he's still a spy, as far as I'm concerned. I'll keep my mouth shut, fine, but I'm not closing my eyes... not for a wink.~
@40703=~I hope he's not always like this.~
@40704=~He is.~
@40705=~You should see him when he's been drinking.~
@40706=~Don't worry about him. I run a tight ship. He's more bark than bite, anyway.~
@40707=~Great. I guess I'll get accustomed to it. At least he's not the worst I've ever had on my team.~
@40708=~Who was that?~
@40709=~Me neither. But you can't always pick the ones you want.~
@40710=~A half-ogre named Durkarg stumbled onto our camp back home and tried to join the clan. He was drunk and stupid and stank, but he was strong. I figured we could use the muscle.~
@40711=~Three days later, he got in a fight with our shaman. He didn't like the way she treated his wounds. It took twenty goblins to bring him down. We never did get our shaman back.~
@40712=~I'd rather not.~
@40713=~I hope so. It's my life you're gambling with.~
@40714=~- Together where they belong -
 - A reminder of what could have been -
 - What I could have kept -~
@40715=~Why give spider to little goblin? Give to Vrek.~
@40716=~I'll make it up to you later.~
@40717=~Sorry, Vrek. That little goblin might have information we really need.~
@40718=~We'll find more, Vrek. Besides, Pondmuk won't be able to eat it all. There should be plenty left.~
@40719=~All right, you can have one.~
@40720=~Vrek waiting. Vrek remember.~
@40721=~If goblin not know anything, Vrek will eat it.~
@40722=~Fair enough.~
@40723=~Honestly, you can eat him even if he does know something... just as long as you wait until he tells us.~
@40724=~Look, I'll find you something else to eat, okay?~
@40725=~Vrek not want to share.~
@40726=~Good.~
@40727=~*crunch* *crunch*~
@40728=~*crunch*~
@40729=~How is it?~
@40730=~Really wish I hadn't seen that.~
@40731=~I hope that's enough for a few hours at least.~
@40732=~You gave the troll, Vrek, a spider to eat.~
@40733=~Vrek was waiting for this part.~
@40734=~You gave the troll, Vrek, some Pondmuk to eat.~
@40735=~Vrek, now it's your turn. Go ahead.~
@40736=~I knew your mission would be dangerous, but I did not anticipate the nature of the battle at the bridge. I have never faced so many foes at once... nor been so afraid for my life.~
@40737=~I know what you mean. The horde has a bad habit of surprising us, and we have a bad habit of underestimating its strength.~
@40738=~Is this too much for you?~
@40739=~I hope you're not having regrets. We need all the help we can get.~
@40740=~It's understandable.~
@40741=~You're always free to leave, Emma.~
@40742=~Understandable, but still problematic. I am no stranger to combat, but this is the first time I've truly felt fear.~
@40743=~I admit, I am hesitant to continue on this path. But I can hardly walk away. If the horde is this powerful, it would be irresponsible for me not to come to Targos' aid.~
@40744=~I'm glad to hear it.~
@40745=~Doing what's right is seldom easy.~
@40746=~There's no shame in walking away. You have another life to lead, and other things to fight for, I'm sure.~
@40747=~*sigh* You are right. I cannot turn away from Targos in its time of need. I admit, I am hesitant to continue on this path. But I shall not walk away.~
@40748=~Perhaps, but is it something I could do in good conscience? I do not think I could live with myself if I turned away from Targos in its time of need. But the situation is dire, and we are outnumbered. We *must* be careful in future missions. If we stumble upon another fight like that at the bridge, we might not be so lucky.~
@40749=~Maybe we should take a more subtle approach on the next mission.~
@40750=~I'm not sure I'd call us lucky right now.~
@40751=~I think the fight was encouraging. We've been sharpening our skills since we arrived in Targos, and it shows. There was a time when those bugbears would have trampled over us, but we are much stronger now.~
@40752=~Agreed. Hopefully our next assignment will be a little safer.~
@40753=~I will not turn away from Targos in its time of need. But the situation is dire, and we are outnumbered. We *must* be careful in future missions. If we stumble upon another fight like that at the bridge, we might not be so lucky.~
@40754=~I agree. This war may last a long time, and we will need to survive to see the end.~
@40755=~I suppose not, and I don't expect that to change. The next battle will be worse. We had best be prepared.~
@40756=~That may be. But I would encourage you not to become overconfident. We must be judicious about the risks we take on. One bad decision could cost us our lives.~
@40757=~That would be very welcome, indeed.~
@40758=~True, but I did not think *I* would ever struggle to do so. Selune has been kind to me. In retrospect, I have experienced very little hardship in my life so far. Now that trend is changing, and I must adjust.~
@40759=~Have you ever had second thoughts about adventuring? It is not a lifestyle many people are suited to.~
@40760=~It can be terrifying, sure. Exhausting, too. And yes, there's always a chance you take an axe to the skull or an arrow to the knee. But there's good things about it, too.~
@40761=~Sometimes.~
@40762=~I've never really thought about it. The adventurer's life sort of just... happened to me.~
@40763=~I don't think I've gone a single day without having second thoughts, to be honest.~
@40764=~What is it that keeps you going?~
@40765=~It makes me feel alive. Knowing that your every decision can make the difference between life and death... it's exciting. ~
@40766=~Gold. Everyone's got to make a living.~
@40767=~Gold. That's about it.~
@40768=~There are people to protect. Ideals to stand for. Tyrants to topple, and dragons to slay. I can't stand by and leave the world undefended.~
@40769=~Curiosity, I suppose. There's no better way to learn than by getting your hands dirty. And adventuring takes you to strangest places.~
@40770=~Hm. I'd rather not say, actually.~
@40771=~A curious idea. That's precisely what I find most alarming. The prospect of making a poor choice, and seeing others suffer or die because of it.~
@40772=~Eh, you make the best choices you can. The rest is just luck, or fate.~
@40773=~Uh... I was actually thinking more about *my* life being at risk. That's what I find exciting.~
@40774=~Worrying is a bad idea. I try not to do it.~
@40775=~Best not to think about it.~
@40776=~Hm. I suppose that's all we can do. I will have to be content with that.~
@40777=~I see. I hope that that doesn't lead you to take large risks. I sense there will be little room for mistakes in the days to come.~
@40778=~You should. Sometimes there are good reasons to worry.~
@40779=~*sigh* I hope that that doesn't lead you to take large risks. I sense there will be little room for mistakes in the days to come.~
@40780=~Gold is the source of many ills. Still, I do not blame you if you only wish to provide for yourself and your family. Times are hard, and not every harvest brings enough to feed the hungry.~
@40781=~*sigh* There are greater things in life than coin, friend. I hope someday you will embrace them.~
@40782=~I feel the same way. I suppose that's all that really matters. I should not complain about my own petty fears. Not when so much else is at stake.~
@40783=~It does. It truly does.~
@40784=~Fair enough. I shall not pry, if that is your wish.~
@40785=~Curious. That is very unlike my own motives. The life of a priest is usually very purposeful. Everything has a reason, a greater intention. Whatever it is that guides you, I hope it leads you in the right direction.~
@40786=~No, it would be shameful for me to refuse the call to action. I must swallow my fears. The road ahead has little room for them.~
@40787=~We must be cautious about our approach. We cannot afford to fight another chaotic battle like that at the Shaengarne Bridge. Our victory there was very narrow, and the horde's forces are no doubt even stronger here. If we draw too much attention to ourselves, we could be overwhelmed.~
@40788=~This is the heart of the horde. If we're going to break its strength, we'd have to do it here. But there are eyes everywhere. It won't be easy to get close.~
@40789=~We do have one advantage still. The horde is not expecting us here.~
@40790=~Emma, your magic can get us past a few goblins, right?~
@40791=~A little magic should take us a long way. I doubt anything here can see the invisible.~
@40792=~I can slip past a few sleepy goblins... Just so long as you're there to back me up if I get spotted.~
@40793=~They might not be expecting us in particular, but they did spot Ennelia and Braston not long ago. So they are probably on the watch for some sort of intruder. The element of surprise probably won't last long.~
@40794=~Selune can help hide one of us, but all magic has its limits. Do not expect it to protect us from *every* danger.~
@40795=~I will be close at hand, friend. Still, be careful. There are some situations I could not save you from.~
@40796=~I wouldn't count on that. Surely at least one of them at Shaengarne snuck away to tell the fortress of their defeat at the bridge.~
@40797=~Just how far can that take us? I'm guessing it doesn't last forever.~
@40798=~Far enough to understand our surroundings, at least. Then we can figure out a battle plan.~
@40799=~Hm. Maybe not very far, come to think of it. Magic has limits. But it'll do something, I hope.~
@40800=~Leave the details to me. I can handle it.~
@40801=~Good. I don't want to take any chances. Not when we're this close to the enemy.~
@40802=~You *hope*? We need better than just hope.~
@40803=~If you have a better idea, by all means, tell me.~
@40804=~Just trying not to make promises I can't keep.~
@40805=~We have what we have. Let's just try to make the most of it.~
@40806=~I wish I did. All right, let's see how far we can get.~
@40807=~Fine. Let's see what it can do.~
@40808=~True. I don't mean to seem ungrateful. I'm just not liking our odds.~
@40809=~Don't get cocky. If you make a mistake, all of us will have to pay for it.~
@40810=~I'll be there. Good luck.~
@40811=~Gods, this place reeks... Burnt hair, rotting meat, goblin dung, and I don't even know what else.~
@40812=~*spits* Whole place stinks of goblin. I don't know how they can stand it in here. Maybe the little wretches *like* the smell.~
@40813=~By Selune, the smell here is overpowering. These tunnels have not been cleaned in a long time.~
@40814=~Vrek smell many things here. Goblin, orc, chicken, cow, spider, and troll. Something else, too. *snort* Something... different.~
@40815=~This tunnel had better lead somewhere. If this is just the fortress' trash heap, I'm going to be very disappointed.~
@40816=~I'm sure it does. They wouldn't have built that great gate in front of the entrance if nothing important was here.~
@40817=~Smell or no smell, there must be something important down here. They would not have built that great gate in front of the entrance otherwise.~
@40818=~I bet Veira can't smell a thing. I envy her.~
@40819=~We better not have fought our way past all those orcs just to wade into a dung heap.~
@40820=~I smell a hint of smoke, too, and cooked meat. I suspect some goblins or orcs have set up camp in here. They probably won't be on high alert if this is a resting spot, but I'm sure there are still a lot of them.~
@40821=~Vrek, you smell other trolls?~
@40822=~If something so important is here, why do they treat the place like a trash heap?~
@40823=~They're goblins, Reig.~
@40824=~It's not necessarily treasure, or anything fragile. Maybe this is part of their supply chain-how they get food to their troops. If this is the bottom of the chain, that would explain the mess. But deeper into the tunnels, we might find where they've been carting the food from... which would be closer to the heart of the fortress. Closer to the horde *leadership,* Reig.~
@40825=~The smell might just be concentrated goblin. The caves trap the smells that would otherwise get aired out if we were above ground.~
@40826=~I'm just trying to be optimistic.~
@40827=~Hm. You may be right. That's good news. I think we're heading in the right direction.~
@40828=~I hate to think of how it smells deeper inside. I guess we'll find out soon enough.~
@40829=~I've had trouble staying positive. All our prayers didn't stop the goblins from... *sigh* Nevermind. I'm not going to fault you for trying.~
@40830=~- All smells are muted -
 - But even I can sense it here -
 - Death and rot and hunger -
 - These creatures have been ill-fed -~
@40831=~If the horde has been underfeeding the creatures here, that might make things easier. Morale is low, the troops are feeling weak... that might open some opportunities. We bribed Vrek with food, after all. Maybe we can do the same thing here.~
@40832=~If the horde has been underfeeding the creatures here, that might make things easier. Morale is low, the troops are feeling weak... that might open some opportunities.~
@40833=~Great. They'll be even *hungrier* for our flesh, then.~
@40834=~I hope that means there's a food shortage. An army can fall apart very quickly if the soldiers get hungry. Might be worth it to ruin some food or poison some water, if we get the opportunity.~
@40835=~Not trolls like Vrek. *Land* troll, not river troll.~
@40836=~What else can you tell us? Any ideas what we might be facing?~
@40837=~You mentioned spiders?~
@40838=~*snort* *snort* Vrek might smell ogre. Might smell bugbear. Vrek not know. But goblins did cooking. Chicken. Cow. Could be others. Vrek not know.~
@40839=~You mentioned something smelled "different."~
@40840=~Anything else?~
@40841=~Not many spiders. Most smell is goblin and orc.~
@40842=~Anything else unusual?~
@40843=~Gods, I hate spiders. I hope we don't run into any.~
@40844=~Spiders good food. Chewy, but good.~
@40845=~*shudder* If we run into any, please do eat all you can. I can't stand the monsters.~
@40846=~I'll pass. What else did you notice?~
@40847=~Vrek smell something else. *snort* Dark. Different. *snort* ...Burning. Dark burning.~
@40848=~Burning as in... fire? Or something else?~
@40849=~That sounds a little ominous.~
@40850=~Dark fire. Magic fire? Vrek not know.~
@40851=~Like sulfur?~
@40852=~*snort* Dark smell. Sour. *Different.*~
@40853=~Something unnatural, you think?~
@40854=~Yes.~
@40855=~Hm. Could be magical, could be extraplanar. A demon, a wizard, a warlock? If it's not just normal magic, if it's from another plane... that's definitely news. Thank you, Vrek. This has been very illuminating.~
@40856=~That was close. Thank the gods he didn't draw more attention to us.~
@40857=~Argh, and here's the *biggest* reason I wanted to leave this place.~
@40858=~These are some sort of goblin-devils. They can make themselves look like goblins, but that's not their true form. They're really some nasty fiend out of my shaman's worst stories. The one over there got *really* good at pretending to be a goblin in my tribe, only to devour several of us when we let our guard down!~
@40859=~The worst thing is, most weapons do nothing to them. If an orc comes to steal our food, we can just shoot them down. But I'm the only one in my tribe with a weapon that can hurt these things.~
@40860=~I have grave reservations about our tactics. I am not fond of bloodshed, but there are times that call for it. I do not believe Guthma can be trusted.~
@40861=~You told me after the fight at Shaengarne that you were worried about the risks we were taking. You wanted a safer approach, something that could keep us alive. This is it. We dodged a fight we might have lost, and we still walked away with a victory. Targos is safe, and that's what matters.~
@40862=~What's done is done, Emma.~
@40863=~Neither do I. But Guthma has other enemies in the Legion, and we have exploited that split. Our enemies will fight each other before they attack us again. That's a far more effective outcome than simply slaying Guthma, in my opinion.~
@40864=~We will return to deal with Guthma when the time comes. We haven't backed away from a fight; we've chosen a better time for it.~
@40865=~A temporary safety. Soon Guthma will bring the fight to Targos again. But I suppose you are right. This was the safer option and... it accomplished most of our goals. Our main goal, at least.~
@40866=~I am sorry; I do not mean to question your judgment. I respect what you've managed to achieve. I merely wish we had a more complete solution.~
@40867=~Someday we shall. Guthma's time is coming soon enough.~
@40868=~I appreciate it, Emma. I'm glad I have your support.~
@40869=~It's understandable. I have my reservations, too. But I think we've gotten what we needed.~
@40870=~I am glad. I hope I shall be there when that day comes.~
@40871=~And I am glad to give it, friend.~
@40872=~I agree. And I'm glad that you understand my perspective as well.~
@40873=~It does not have to be. If you wish, we could go back and kill Guthma, and free Braston. Ennelia would like that much more. But I will leave it up to you.~
@40874=~But should Guthma should change his mind, and attack Targos rather than ambush the Legion, we have sacrificed a valuable opportunity to cut off the head of the beast. If he orders another attack, it will not be so easy for us to breach the fortress again.~
@40875=~Point taken. We should think about what measures he might take to shore up the fortress's defenses-if he does break our deal, it might still be best to strike him from his headquarters rather than fight his forces on the battlefield.~
@40876=~I am aware of the risk, Emma. But fighting Guthma was a risk as well. War is about trading advantages and calculating risks. Not just muscle and steel.~
@40877=~He is in a poor position to attack Targos, I think. We've thinned his forces and exposed his weaknesses in the eyes of his own men. Even if Guthma lives, the horde has been dealt a heavy blow.~
@40878=~I pray that that will not be necessary. But I fear the worst.~
@40879=~That may be, but I hope you understand that it is not just a game of chess we are playing. The stakes are very real, and people will suffer and die if we should lose.~
@40880=~That is true. I don't know how much we've weakened the horde, but Targos is at least safer than it was before we left. I pray that that safety is enduring.~
@40881=~I hope so. If the gambit works, the horde and the Legion will clash, and perhaps one of them will fall. Perhaps the victor will be weak enough for the Ten Towns to defeat alone.~
@40882=~Hm.~
@40883=~Hmmm... *might*. He's probably planning on killing us even if we whine and beg at his feet. That is what I would do, if I were in his place. We should probably kill him now.~
@40884=~So. This "Legion of the Chimera" is responsible for the horde and the ice wall both. But we still know so little about their motives, or their connection to Auril.~
@40885=~This definitely sheds some light on things. The Legion is broader than we realized. Guthma was only one arm of the monster, and the Aurilites another. We don't know just how many allies they have, or what their long-term goal is. But it sounds like this whole project has been many years in the making. And yet, we've never heard of it.~
@40886=~If the wall is Auril's work, we can expect many powerful priests inside it... and perhaps more barbarians, if Sherincal's guards are any indication.~
@40887=~- A vast Legion -
 - Stretching its fingers across Icewind Dale -
 - To every evil it can find -~
@40888=~Clean human. Dirty human. Vrek smell white bear also.~
@40889=~I h-hope the people inside are a little more friendly. P-probably not, though.~
@40890=~Damn lizard bitch had it coming. *spits* I bet the whole place is crawling with those white-haired fanatics. Come on... let's paint this wall red.~
@40891=~I've heard of the Heartstone Gem before. Used to belong to a powerful demon named Yxunomei a few decades back, before some adventurers took it from her. Powerful divination in it, so it's not surprising the Aurilites want it. And Auril *has* always wanted the tree at Kuldahar destroyed. It's kind of her thing.~
@40892=~That is not good news. Targos has barely been able to stand up to the Legion's forces. Kuldahar is not a big place, and probably not well-defended.~
@40893=~I wonder if the Legion would actually hand over the gem to the Aurilites, or if they'd keep it for themselves.~
@40894=~Why is that?~
@40895=~They do have an archdruid over in Kuldahar. Might be enough to fend off the Legion; who knows? Well... maybe not... if the Legion has a whole army.~
@40896=~Well, let's hope for the best! The worst that can happen is... ah, let's not think about that, actually.~
@40897=~No idea. It's probably a bad idea to cross the Frostmaiden. But hey, maybe they won't get the chance, right?~
@40898=~Oh, Kuldahar is an oasis! The great tree has strong magic in it. Keeps the whole town warm and green. But Auril doesn't like warmth and green stuff, so she's been wanting to snuff it out for a while now.~
@40899=~Not my favorite goddess, to be honest. She's kind of mean.~
@40900=~I understand your desire to find allies wherever we can, but I wish our alliance with the devil to end soon. Devils' bargains always come at a price, and they are never honest dealers. It is an evil creature you have brought with us.~
@40901=~Noted.~
@40902=~We've made allies with monsters before. The last time we did, it went very well.~
@40903=~The deal is temporary. We'll part ways when we can replace him.~
@40904=~Don't worry; I'm not going to let myself be outsmarted.~
@40905=~Zack, devils abide by their agreements, don't they?~
@40906=~But a very powerful one, and one we will need in the days to come.~
@40907=~Xhaan owes us. We freed him and his cohorts.~
@40908=~I'm flattered.~
@40909=~I shall grant that Vunarg has conducted himself well-better, I admit, than I would have expected-but a creature of the Hells is far different from any mortal. He is an alien being, and his motives and thoughts are beyond our comprehension.~
@40910=~I hope that day comes soon. Even the most black-hearted of mercenaries would be most trustworthy than a beast from the Hells.~
@40911=~Keen minds have believed the same thing, and been proven wrong. Many mages who have struck deals with devils have lost their lives and their souls because of their own hubris. Please, do not make their mistakes.~
@40912=~They sure do! In the letter of the agreement, if not the spirit. In fact... usually *against* the spirit of the agreement. And sometimes at the cost of the bargainer's life. Or soul. But you can definitely expect Xhaan to be *technically* true to his word.~
@40913=~I think.~
@40914=~We should sever contact with the devil as soon as possible. Our lives are at stake, and the Ten Towns still need us.~
@40915=~For your sake and mine, I pray that that power will come to our aid, and not to our detriment. But we are playing with powerful forces we do not understand.~
@40916=~A devil's gratitude will not secure our safety. In the eyes of a devil, a mortal is nothing more than a tool to be used and discarded.~
@40917=~You know, I've never traveled with a devil before! Awfully big creature, aren't you? I hope we can, uh, get along.~
@40918=~I am only here because we have a common enemy, mortal. This group is currently more useful to me alive than dead. Currently. Would you consider that "getting along" sufficiently?~
@40919=~Oh, ah, yes!~
@40920=~Xhaan? I had a small question. Just curious.~
@40921=~Speak.~
@40922=~I had an idea for a new experiment-academic reasons, you know-and, uh, you might be able to help with one of the c-commopements. Components.~
@40923=~Is it my blood, mortal?~
@40924=~Uh... yes. And maybe if I could d-dip the end of your tail in a solution? Just for a bit. Teensy bit. Just a little..~
@40925=~Really? How badly do you want it, then? Get on your knees and beg, mortal, and *maybe* I might give you some of my blood.~
@40926=~Yes, yes, please! Give me some of your blood!~
@40927=~NO! You are not getting even a drop of my blood. The next time you want something from me, you had better have more bargaining power than that.~
@40928=~Ow, that hurt! And you broke the vial I was going to store it in! I'll have to find another one...~
@40929=~Speak, human.~
@40930=~I have nothing to say to *you,* devil.~
@40931=~Yet you stare at me. Something is on your mind.~
@40932=~Yes. But I don't have anything to say to you.~
@40933=~Wise.~
@40934=~Hoo-*hoo!* Wow! That was horrifying. Let's never ever do that again.~
@40935=~This has been a really fascinating experience! This place is full of *so* many weird magical gizmos beneath the ice! It's a marvel...~
@40936=~I'm freezing my stones off.~
@40937=~Incredible talent went into it. Shame we have to tear it all down.~
@40938=~Beautiful, isn't it?~
@40939=~I don't know how you stay focused on the "gizmos" when we've got polar bears and barbarians stalking us around every corner.~
@40940=~Enjoy it while it lasts. We don't plan on preserving the wall, "fascinating experience" or no.~
@40941=~Keep your voice down, Zack. The walls echo every sound we make, and Aurilites could be anywhere.~
@40942=~Oh, I have a cream that could help with that! Aocha's feet have always been very sensitive, you know, and when she was complaining about walking over the snow a few weeks ago, I *had* to come up with a remedy. Let me see if I can find where I put it...~
@40943=~On second thought, I'm feeling fine.~
@40944=~I am *not* putting spider footrub cream on my privates, gnome.~
@40945=~It was a figure of speech, Zack. But if it can warm up my fingers, by all means, I'd love to try it.~
@40946=~Really? Wow, that was quick. It's just as well; I'm not sure the cream is still good... it's been a few weeks. But if you ever need it, just let me know!~
@40947=~Sourpuss. All right, fine. But don't come crawling back to me when you're growing icicles between your legs.~
@40948=~Ah, here it is. Enjoy! It's been a few weeks since I made it, but it's probably still good.~
@40949=~Don't remind me. I mean, I know *why* it needs to come down. I understand that. But still... you don't come across things like this every day. I guess I'll just have to treasure the moments while I can.~
@40950=~It really is. All magic is beautiful, in my opinion. And this great temple has such delicate geometry. I'm really going to miss it.~
@40951=~You know what? I'm going to take a souvenir. Maybe I can chisel a chunk of ice out of the wall and take it home with me.~
@40952=~Won't it melt?~
@40953=~Maybe. But if I can break it off *juuust* right, I should be able to preserve the enchantment on the ice. It's self-healing, you know. I just need to find the right spot...~
@40954=~What? Oh, right, the bears. Nasty things, they are. But look at the walls! They have such delicate geometry... if you can read the magic, anyhow. It's a work of art, really. In my opinion, of course, *all* magic is art.~
@40955=~You never seem to worry about anything.~
@40956=~It's good thing you're not traveling alone. At least *one* of us is paying attention to the danger around us.~
@40957=~You're going to end up in the belly of another remorhaz someday, Zack.~
@40958=~What's there to worry about? Oh, you mean the bears?~
@40959=~Or anything, really.~
@40960=~And the barbarians, and the priests, and the massive golems who keep trying to bash our heads in.~
@40961=~I never saw the point of worrying. It just gets in the way of living your life.~
@40962=~Right, right. Maybe I should keep my eyes open. I'd hate to get eaten again!~
@40963=~You know, if Isair and Madae are the leaders of the Legion, then maybe their fiendish parent isn't part of the Legion-otherwise their parent would be the leader. That would be good news. Unless, of course, the Legion's *real* leader is being kept secret from us.~
@40964=~That's what Aocha is for! She's always looked out for danger for the two of us. She's very good at it... Maybe because she's got four times as many eyes as me.~
@40965=~Oh, right, the Aurilites. There's been quite a lot of them, haven't there?~
@40966=~There should be. It's their temple.~
@40967=~*sigh* Never mind. If you can't pay attention, I'll have to do it for both of us.~
@40968=~Weird, isn't it?~
@40969=~That makes sense. It's a pity such a beautiful home has such unfriendly people in it. Real shame.~
@40970=~Well, Aurilites like ice. It shouldn't be too surprising, honestly.~
@40971=~Mm. You never seem to worry about anything, Zack.~
@40972=~It's good thing you're not traveling alone. At least *one* of us is paying attention to the danger around us.~
@40973=~You're going to end up in the belly of another remorhaz someday, gnome.~
@40974=~Well, that was weird.~
@40975=~- A heartless creature -
 - Preying on children -
 - There is no greater crime -~
@40976=~- And now she is free -
 - Will her fear stay her hand -
 - Or will she continue her crimes when we are gone -~
@40977=~We should have killed the bitch. She deserves to rot in the Hells.~
@40978=~I would rather have held the witch accountable for her actions. But the important thing is that the children are safe.~
@40979=~A truly vile person. But I'm glad that the children are okay! Let's hurry back to the village.~
@40980=~We have made our deal with the witch. She is no longer our concern. On to more pressing matters.~
@40981=~Avoiding a fight was the wise decision. I'd rather not see the witch turn *us* into minks.~
@40982=~Damn it! The self-righteous devils already ran off to whatever pit they crawled out of. We should have split them open when we had the chance!~
@40983=~My heart is still pounding... *This* is what you all have been fighting? I'm worried... My village is not the only one in danger.~
@40984=~The leaders of the Legion travel without bodyguards. I guess they don't *need* guards; they're powerful spellcasters on their own. As much as I'd like to have ended things then and there, it's probably best that they left. I'm not sure we're ready to take them on right now.~
@40985=~Isair and Madae ally themselves with goblinoid hordes and evil gods, yet they still have pretensions to fighting for justice. We are dealing with the worst kind of zealotry here. Blind rage. I wonder where they came from?~
@40986=~I've studied a little about cambions, though I don't know much. They're the progeny of a fiend and a mortal, but... that display of their magic was not normal. Being able to kill the living and raise the dead in one great swoop like that? That's not something *any* cambion can do. Whatever fiend spawned them, it must have been a big one.~
@40987=~I'm starting to get the Legion's relationship with goblinoid clans. Isair and Madae viewed us as natural allies because we're so often at war with humans. But if Sherincal's arguments with Guthma are any indication, the feeling wasn't mutual; Guthma and the horde were only fighting for the Legion for strictly practical reasons-it was a way to get support in a war against the humans.~
@40988=~Xhaan, those two are your kin, right? Can you tell us anything about them?~
@40989=~Half-fiends come in several types. Some are half-demon, which we often slay in the Blood War. But I could tell these are half-devil.~
@40990=~So yes, they are my kin. But even family means little in the Nine Hells, much less distant kinship. Whatever devil sired these two would have them tortured to death at the first sign of disobedience, as I would any imp under my control.~
@40991=~Half-devils cannot be promoted, so I would say they are more suited to this plane than the Nine Hells. Here, they could potentially dominate and repress a large population, rather than just the few lemures that would be allotted to them elsewhere.~
@40992=~I'm glad you're taking me with you. The woods are at peace now, and the spirits have us to thank! I hope we can do the same in the future.~
@40993=~We intend to. But it may be harder than you think.~
@40994=~Don't get your hopes up. We're just here to finish a job and get home; nothing more.~
@40995=~I'm afraid not every place we've visited is like this, and the aftermath has not been so clean. We've left peace in our wake, relatively speaking, but a field of dead bodies is only "at peace" in the coldest sense of the word.~
@40996=~And we're glad to have you, Pairi. You've been helpful, and we appreciate you.~
@40997=~The future is going to be bloody, Pairi, and very dark.~
@40998=~Oh, I know. But I'm already learning so much! Whatever comes next, I think I'll be ready for it.~
@40999=~I hope so. Just don't underestimate the challenges ahead.~
@41000=~Famous last words. Be on your guard, Pairi. The road we travel is not a safe one.~
@41001=~I think so, too.~
@41002=~I like your attitude. We could definitely use a little more optimism in our group.~
@41003=~And I'm happy to share it. Lead the way!~
@41004=~All right. But so far, I like the way things are going.~
@41005=~Oh... I see.~
@41006=~I don't mean to scare you. I just want you to understand the danger ahead.~
@41007=~The world is a cold place, little one. You must be strong if you're plan on surviving.~
@41008=~You might not be suited for the adventuring life. You won't really know until you've been at it for a while.~
@41009=~We do good work; I'll give ourselves that much credit. But it *will* be difficult.~
@41010=~Steel yourself. We've a long way to go.~
@41011=~Okay. Thank you. I understand completely.~
@41012=~I guess so. Maybe we'll just to see how it goes, huh?~
@41013=~Thank you! I promise I'll do my best. Thank you so much for bringing me along.~
@41014=~Oh, this is awful! *This* is what happened to the children? You kidnapped them and drained their life away?~
@41015=~And who are *you* to object, half-elf? You will get to live for nearly two hundred years for free; I had to toil for years to learn the dark secrets necessary for me to live half that long!~
@41016=~Impressive. That was some deadly magic those two cambions had. I sometimes forget that half-fiends can become so powerful.~
@41017=~The Aurilites seemed to feel the same way. Cathin, that axe-wielding priestess back at the temple, said they were only interested in grabbing the Heartstone Gem. Like the horde, they only made friends with the Legion to achieve their own goals. That might be good news. For us, at least. Their alliance seems pretty fragile.~
@41018=~Half-devils are a low-ranking caste on my plane and cannot be promoted. However, the greatest of them are comparable to greater devils in their magical ability and fighting skill, or perhaps even better. And these may be the most powerful cambions I have seen in my entire existence.~
@41019=~All right. Then strong I will be, and I will brave the cold.~
@41020=~Oh... Oh wow...~
@41021=~Hah! *huff* *huff* Now that... that was a proper fight. Look at us now! Slayers of dragons!~
@41022=~Whether human or orc or otherwise, *no* creature deserves to be in shackles. I shall not allow this monstrosity to continue!~
@41023=~You stupid, stupid human.~
@41024=~Emma, you *cannot* be so impulsive. You almost got us killed picking a fight with a whole compound like this.~
@41025=~If this party would not stand against slavery, I would no longer be a part of it. It is an abomination in the eyes of both Selune and anyone who knows justice from injustice!~
@41026=~We really should have waited on picking a fight until the time was right. There probably would have been a time when their leader was alone or with a only a small group, and we could have taken that time to strike.~
@41027=~Perhaps I could have delayed a moment-I will grant that much. But I do not regret my actions. I could not have allowed it to continue and still call myself a Silverstar of Selune.~
@41028=~Harshom's attack gives me pause. Back at the village, Isair and Madae did not consider us a threat at all. If Harshom was dispatched recently, that could mean that the Legion now recognizes us a meaningful threat... and has been tracking our movements. If he was dispatched long ago, of course, that's less cause for concern.~
@41029=~But eventually, the Legion will recognize us as a real threat, and when that time comes, they will send stronger assassins after us. The Legion has more than enough magic and resources to spy on us from wherever their true base of operations is.~
@41030=~Eh, whoever they send after us won't last long. We've fought harder battles than that mage.~
@41031=~It could take time before real assassins come our way. Isair was very clear about his contempt for us as enemies. I think he's the type to underestimate his foes.~
@41032=~It might not be relevant just yet. But another group of assassins will find us someday, and they will be well prepared.~
@41033=~This is going to be difficult. I feel naked without a weapon.~
@41034=~Damn monks. Why do we have to put up with this?~
@41035=~Selune, please guide my hand...~
@41036=~I feel like a caged wolf.~
@41037=~No arms and no armor. I've got this.~
@41038=~I didn't think I'd be here so soon. I hope I'm ready...~
@41039=~Tedious tasks. I wish them to be over soon.~
@41040=~Fascinating contraptions around here... I wonder what they've got in store for us.~
@41041=~Such a waste of magical talent. I wish I'd had more time to learn about her research. We can dig around her notes, but it's not the same...~
@41042=~I have to question your priorities, Zack. Magic is only as good as the people who wield it, and I see no good in any of this.~
@41043=~After seeing the abominations Imphraili created, I think her research is best left unexplored.~
@41044=~I wish we had the luxury of time. I hate to leave valuable knowledge behind us.~
@41045=~I just want to get out of this pit. It reeks of foul magic.~
@41046=~I think we're done here. Let's just go back to Malavon and report our success.~
@41047=~Sorry, Zack, but we're not done. We still need to destroy the rest of her work. The Viciscamera is still here.~
@41048=~Maybe someday you can come back and study the remains of her work. There'll probably still be some clues left to uncover.~
@41049=~Not at all! I think her work could be used for all sorts of things. Why, it could tell me so much about Aocha's own morphology! And I've always wondered what it would be like to turn myself into a spider.~
@41050=~What?~
@41051=~I'm not surprised.~
@41052=~Not much different from turning into any other animal.~
@41053=~I've done it before. It feels... twitchy, I would say. Twitchy and hungry.~
@41054=~Me, too.~
@41055=~Well, you can't spend as much time as I have around Aocha without getting a *little* curious. She's a beautiful creature, in her own way, and she's so much smarter than most people think! Aren't you, Aocha?~
@41056=~I'm happy for you, Zack.~
@41057=~I'm worried about you, Zack.~
@41058=~Oh, I don't know about that. A spider is a unique creature. Not to speak ill of other animals, of course, but an eight-legged, eight-eyed crawler that can spin its own silk? Now *that* is a rare animal!~
@41059=~ What was I talking about, anyway? Oh, right, the dead mage. So many lost opportunities...~
@41060=~Yeah, that sounds like Aocha. Maybe someday I'll be able to experience it myself.~
@41061=~You have good taste, my friend. Very good taste.~
@41062=~Me, too. Maybe someday we could come back and see if more of her work could be salvaged. A question for another day, I suppose.~
@41063=~Sourpuss. Oh, well. I suppose not everyone can appreciate the finer aspects of the Art. To each their own...~
@41064=~Even worse! That old drow has the strangest priorities. Messing up a perfectly good spider-mutater thingy! What a shame...~
@41065=~That would be nice. I guess it could be a while, though. The Legion's probably up to *lots* more mischief. I wish we could just ask someone else to handle it.~
@41066=~Ah, the thrill of a new invention! Pity we have to use it on the Viciscamera. But this is so *neat!*~
@41067=~Is... is Zack *always* like this?~
@41068=~He is. I find it kind of charming.~
@41069=~I hope this thing works. I'm tired and I don't want to have to destroy the thing with brute force.~
@41070=~Let's just get this over with. I feel like eyes are watching us from every corner.~
@41071=~I've heard legends about these creatures. Alien things from another plane who enslave other races and eat their brains. And now we're in their home.~
@41072=~The air feels weird in here... warped and crackly. Something's wrong.~
@41073=~Vrek not like this. Mind flayer makes Vrek dizzy.~
@41074=~We'll have to stay focused. Everything in here is trying to mess with our heads.~
@41075=~Illithids are bad news. One of them is bad enough, but a whole bunch of them is... well, I'm sure we can manage. I just hope we don't have to kill the elder brain or anything, heh. We'd probably die!~
@41076=~Illithids are a powerful and arrogant race. If you allow them to dull your senses, they will devour you. But if you steel your mind, their flesh is as soft as any human's. Slice open their bodies before they slice open your mind.~
@41077=~Well done. Putting fear into a master brain is no small feat. Few mortals could accomplish it.~
@41078=~Valley all smell like rot. No fresh meat. Rot and oil and snake.~
@41079=~This is so sad... I've heard stories about Kuldahar, and all the life that blossoms around it. That big orog has turned a beautiful valley into a rotting graveyard. We *have* to cleanse this place. It's not right.~
@41080=~There are so many restless spirits in the wake of the Legion. Wherever they tread, death and chaos seem to follow. It will take arduous labor to undo the damage, and it could take years for Icewind Dale to truly heal.~
@41081=~The wounds the Legion has left must be healed, and the work begins with us. Come; we have much to do.~
@41082=~If this is what the valley looks like, I hate to imagine what the Legion did to the great tree.~
@41083=~We'll find some real food for you, Vrek. Don't you worry about that.~
@41084=~We'll find some real food for you, Vrek. But first, we have a lot of spirits to put to rest.~
@41085=~The Legion has desecrated sacred ground here. Nature's wounds must be healed.~
@41086=~Don't let it get to you. More than ever, we need to be strong.~
@41087=~So do I. It hurts to see a sacred place like this torn apart and defiled.~
@41088=~Soon. Vrek not patient.~
@41089=~That Jermsy fellow is so cranky, but I'm not sure I can blame him. It must be hard to see these things happening to your home.~
@41090=~Jermsy reminds me of me, back at the docks. I know what it means to feel helpless and afraid.~
@41091=~Grow some stones, Reig. Y-~
@41092=~Say another word and I break in your teeth, cutthroat-and by now you should know I'm not joking.~
@41093=~I wish I could give the poor man some comfort or reassurance. But I don't really know how.~
@41094=~Neither do I. Don't beat yourself up over it, Reig.~
@41095=~He'll feel better when the dead are back in the ground.~
@41096=~You never seemed helpless or afraid to me, Reig. Angry, sure, but not helpless.~
@41097=~Jermsy will have to take care of himself. We've got more important things to do.~
@41098=~Good advice. Let's just get this over with.~
@41099=~Maybe. But I doubt it. I used to think that I'd feel better when the goblins were gone. But ever since the invasion, I've always felt a little helpless... Even when every last enemy lay dead around us.~
@41100=~Anger gave me the strength to fight, but I never stopped being scared. It's like it burned itself into my brain. Before the goblins attacked, it seemed like a normal day. But if a normal day can turn to hell just like that...~
@41101=~I don't know. I don't think I'll ever feel safe anymore.~
@41102=~You only feel unsafe because the job isn't done yet. When the Legion is gone, truly gone, then we'll be able to rest easy.~
@41103=~It's not really about *us* feeling safe, though, is it? It's about keeping the Ten Towns safe.~
@41104=~You need a drink, friend.~
@41105=~I've got an idea. Let's take some of that fear and put it into the hearts of our enemies.~
@41106=~Me neither.~
@41107=~I hope so. I guess we won't know until the job is done.~
@41108=~You're right. I need to put my emotions aside. There's too much at stake.~
@41109=~No, I don't think so. If I start drinking to escape my fears, I'm just going to drown.~
@41110=~*sigh* Fine. I wish I shared your enthusiasm.~
@41111=~I'm sorry to hear that, friend... And if I ever figure out a solution, I'll let you know.~
@41112=~We're... really going through a portal to Chult? I'm still reeling from the airship ride!~
@41113=~I've never been to a jungle before. I bet it's really beautiful... aside from the yuan-ti, anyway.~
@41114=~The jungle is going to be rough for Aocha. Frost spiders aren't designed for hot environments. I better make some mint balm for her thorax.~
@41115=~I am surprised that the cambions resented their service in the Blood War. Their heritage should have *guided* their minds and led them to the correct path, as it does for many other cambions. Being the progeny of Belhifet himself should have given them a privileged position as well as great power. They are disobedient, or else weak of will.~
@41116=~You disapprove? I'd have thought the twins were evil enough to meet a devil's dark expectations.~
@41117=~Disobedient seems like the word. Their entire lives, it seems, have been spent defying the world around them.~
@41118=~Honestly, I'm glad they're not serving in the Blood War. They've done enough damage without the baatezu by their side.~
@41119=~At least we know Belhifet isn't backing the Legion. That's good news.~
@41120=~I hope that will give you extra incentive to cut them down when we finally meet the twins.~
@41121=~It's unfortunate. I would rather have them fighting the tanar'ri than the Ten Towns.~
@41122=~"Evil" alone is meaningless without direction. These children are without direction, lost and confused to their true purpose. They must be educated.~
@41123=~If you're hoping that you'll have a shot at "educating" them, you'll be disappointed. They won't live long enough to learn any lessons.~
@41124=~I hate to imagine what kind of education you have in mind, devil.~
@41125=~Pain is the best teacher.~
@41126=~I don't think the twins are good students.~
@41127=~No, they will not. We will see to that.~
@41128=~Nor *could* you imagine it, mortal. The order for which the baatezu fight is a concept far beyond your ken.~
@41129=~Agreed. Though I doubt they shall survive the lesson.~
@41130=~You are correct. And a student who will not learn is useless. I look forward to their demise. The punishment for their disobedience is long overdue.~
@41131=~Indeed. They struggle in vain against the natural order, trying to impose their will on an uncaring world. I am ashamed to call them my kin... and I look forward to their demise. The punishment for their disobedience is long overdue.~
@41132=~Baatezu may indeed fight by their side. The twins may have abandoned their true purpose, but I can envision them enlisting their kin for their foolish project. It is possible they made allies during their time in the Blood War... and very likely that their friends among the wizards of Thay have bound my fellow baatezu to their service.~
@41133=~We do not know that to be the case. Isair and Madae may have rejected their role in the Blood War, but Belhifet may still have designs for them-even if they themselves do not know it.~
@41134=~I am an abishai, mortal. I need no further incentive to fulfill a deal.~
@41135=~I do not care about towns of mortals, but yes, I would prefer them fighting the tanar'ri.~
@41136=~- We must speak with Egenia's spirit -
 - Her words may prove our salvation -
 - If we know how to use them -~
@41137=~Could you be more specific?~
@41138=~Our salvation is pretty important to me. We'll see her shortly.~
@41139=~I've never been good with words.~
@41140=~I hope Egenia can fight. Another ghost on our side could come in handy.~
@41141=~- I do not know how -
 - But there is a way to defeat the twins -
 - A way that spares our lives -
 - If not theirs -
 - Egenia is the key -
 - But we must find the lock -~
@41142=~- Our words may fail us -
 - Warm words lost to cold wind -
 - The twins do not understand -
 - Nor do they wish to -
 - But if we make them -
 - We will find a peace of sorts -
 - Bitter and cold -
 - But peace -~
@41143=~- Her struggles are over -
 - And her faith forbids war -
 - But words may command armies -
 - And words may stay their hand -~
@41144=~Finally, someplace warm! I... actually... this is too warm. Damn it! I can already feel sweat on my brow.~
@41145=~This is a welcome change from Icewind Dale. I wonder what it's like to live here... a whole world as warm as a hearth.~
@41146=~I am going to have so many tales to tell to my clan. I wonder how many they'll even believe.~
@41147=~I... I hear so many screams here. I've read that the yuan-ti are torturers, but... My very soul is shaking. I have never been so ready to resort to violence as I am now. We *must* cleanse this insidious temple. We cannot allow a single snake to escape retribution!~
@41148=~I like your attitude!~
@41149=~I'm surprised to see you so eager to kill, Sersa. You never struck me as the confrontational type.~
@41150=~Agreed.~
@41151=~We must proceed with caution, friend. We are outnumbered here. You might not have been present when we infiltrated the horde fortress and the ice temple, but we learned a long time ago to approach these situations with subtlety.~
@41152=~Keep your voice down. We are not here to draw a crowd.~
@41153=~Thank you. But... perhaps we should still be cautious. The snakes could be anywhere. I do not want to be caught off-guard.~
@41154=~Normally, I'm not. But those voices... they change things. This place leaves no room for hesitation.~
@41155=~Good. But... perhaps we should still be cautious. The snakes could be anywhere. I do not want to be caught off-guard.~
@41156=~You're right. I'm sorry. You're more experienced than me, and I'll trust your judgment. But please, we must take action. If we do not bring down this temple, I could not live with myself.~
@41157=~I'm sorry. I'll be careful. But please, we cannot let this temple stand. I could not live with myself if we did any less.~
@41158=~I'm having trouble figuring out how to define a human.~
@41159=~What do you mean?~
@41160=~I assume the half-breeds here are what prompted this question?~
@41161=~I'm not sure you can. I'm *part* human, but that's not the word people use for me.~
@41162=~Really? It always seemed easy to me. A leg or two, some skin, less than seven eyes. Sometimes they come with a mustache.~
@41163=~It's the half-breeds here. All of them are half-human. They're also yuan-ti, I know, but that doesn't mean their human ancestry is any less real. Their mothers were all from Kuldahar; they were born under the same tree. But here they are, in Dragon's Eye, raised by other yuan-ti and taught to worship an evil snake god.~
@41164=~Yes. All of them are half-human. They're also yuan-ti, I know, but that doesn't mean their human ancestry is any less real. Their mothers were all from Kuldahar; they were born under the same tree. But here they are, in Dragon's Eye, raised by other yuan-ti and taught to worship an evil snake god.~
@41165=~That's the strange thing, isn't it? All of these half-breeds are part human, too. Their mothers were all from Kuldahar; they were born under the same tree. But here they are, in Dragon's Eye, raised by other yuan-ti and taught to worship an evil snake god.~
@41166=~I'm serious. It's starting to bother me, because I don't have a real answer.~
@41167=~Imagine one of them was brought to Targos as a baby. The green skin would have marked them as different, and they'd probably have gotten teased a lot for it, but they could have grown up alongside my friends and I. I could have had a yuan-ti half-breed as a best friend... or even fallen in love with one. I might have even had a yuan-ti child myself, green skin and all.~
@41168=~What really makes them different from me? It can't just be skin color. Is it just their upbringing? Is being *raised* by the yuan-ti enough to turn someone evil? Maybe *I* would be fighting for them, if I was raised here, just like those human initiates back in Chult. And if that's true... is it true for the goblins, too? The orcs? Sherincal, the duergar, a *mind flayer?*~
@41169=~Is it true for Isair and Madae?~
@41170=~Does it really matter? However they ended up on the side of the Legion, there's no going back now.~
@41171=~Hard to say. I've wondered what my life would have been like if *I* had been raised by humans. But even after growing up among my kin, here I am, fighting for Targos.~
@41172=~I don't know. I was raised by humans and ended up on the side of the Ten Towns. Maybe I'd be fighting for the Legion, if I was raised among my kin.~
@41173=~I've been wondering the same thing. I might not have quite as much yuan-ti blood as the half-breeds here, but seeing so many people here like me, after spending so much of my life as the only one... I don't know what the difference is between me and them. Maybe there isn't one.~
@41174=~I have yuan-ti blood, too, Reig, and yet here I am, fighting for Targos. The half-breeds here *chose* to fight for an evil cause. Their upbringing is no excuse.~
@41175=~No one forced the half-breeds to fight for the Legion or the snakes. They're here by choice.~
@41176=~No one grows up in isolation. Our childhoods might not *dictate* our future, but they do change where we start out, yes. And most people go along with the world they were raised in.~
@41177=~Maybe. It's hard to pick apart nature from nurture.~
@41178=~Humans have fought for the Legion, too, Reig. There are humans that grow up in human societies and turn out evil, just like there are drow and duergar and goblinoids who grow up alongside their kin and turn out good. Our backgrounds may influence who we are, but we are not slaves to the worlds we came from.~
@41179=~I guess not. Maybe I'm just overthinking things. However things got where they are now, we're stuck with it... Besides, even if one of these half-breeds *could* have been on our side, we're never going to know. No time to philosophize when swords are already drawn.~
@41180=~Right. I shouldn't give the Legion excuses. You grew up the same way as they did, but you turned out different. They could have done the same, but they didn't.~
@41181=~And I'm glad you did.~
@41182=~I don't know why I brought it up... I just don't see the same clear lines between us and the enemy that I used to. It's all blurred. Well, I'm glad you ended up where you did. I don't know where we'd be without you.~
@41183=~Things used to be so much clearer. At the docks, it was simple. But now, I don't know what to think... Maybe I'm overthinking things.~
@41184=~I guess it doesn't matter. Human or yuan-ti or something else, I'm glad you're with us. I don't know where we'd be without you.~
@41185=~You're right. They always had a choice. They still do, really... Just like us, actually. There's nothing stopping either of us from just walking away. But here we are. *All* of us chose to fight.~
@41186=~I don't know about that. I don't think these half-breeds could just walk back to Kuldahar and expect to be treated like any other human. They're rooted here, just like I'm rooted to Targos... *sigh* I'm not sure it makes a difference, though. If any of these half-breeds is good at heart, we'll probably never know it.~
@41187=~I guess so. It's too late to change things now. But maybe the next time there's a generation of half-breeds... we'll keep them close to home, away from enemy hands. Make sure they turn out right.~
@41188=~Things used to be so much clearer. But the lines between us and the enemy seem so blurry now. And I don't think we'll have time to sort them out.~
@41189=~We'll be too busy trying to slash each other's throats.~
@41190=~That's true. Maybe I should stop giving them excuses... It's too late now, anyway. The lines have been drawn; the war is here.~
@41191=~All we can do now is end it.~
@41192=~- This has happened before -
 - Countless people trapped in these caves -
 - Seeing their families eaten by monsters -
 - And waiting to be next -~
@41193=~The yuan-ti's penchant for imprisoning their victims makes my stomach churn. By Selune, we shall *not* allow this to continue.~
@41194=~This is horrible... Just imagine being locked up here, away from the sunlight and your family and at the mercy of the yuan-ti.~
@41195=~I never understood the logic of holding prisoners long-term, personally. Why feed your enemies when you could just throw them to the worgs?~
@41196=~It's just like the temple in Chult. Murder and kidnapping and torture.~
@41197=~Well, *this* time, it's not going to stand. We'll put down every last snake who's foolish enough to stay and fight.~
@41198=~Wow! A full-scale yuan-ti laboratory, right in front of us! I never thought I'd get the chance to explore one. The yuan-ti are talented alchemists, you know. This is a great research opportunity! Let's get into those bookshelves, too. You never know what you might find in a new library...~
@41199=~Ah, what a pleasant surprise! I've missed this place. Oh, but we probably won't be here for very long this time...~
@41200=~What in the world is going on? What kind of favor did you promise that wizard?~
@41201=~It's a long story.~
@41202=~It was a very vague favor. I didn't realize he could actually call us all the way back here.~
@41203=~Hmm... no luck. The devils here appear to have been conventionally summoned, so there's little hope of them being able to promote me. Let's just kill them and move on.~
@41204=~So *this* is the ice temple you had to bring down... it's beautiful... and absolutely massive! Clearing it out must have been incredibly difficult. I'm glad I finally got to see it... though I'd have hoped it would be under better circumstances.~
@41205=~Ah, I see! The wizard summoned not just baatezu, but also tanar'ri for us to kill. It is time to fight some *real* enemies.~
@41206=~Well, it won't last any longer. We'll cleanse this place, too, and woe to any snake who tries to stop us.~
@41207=~Bringing down Guthma was much more satisfying than I expected. We might actually have a chance. But I'm half surprised we're still alive. You have a knack for not dying, townie.~
@41208=~I'm lucky like that.~
@41209=~It wasn't that hard, honestly.~
@41210=~As do you, goblin.~
@41211=~I hope it lasts.~
@41212=~I hope it lasts a long time. Luck always runs out eventually.~
@41213=~Don't get too confident, [PRO_RACE]. It only takes one mistake to get a blade in your neck.~
@41214=~So do I. But it won't. Luck always runs out eventually.~
@41215=~I finally get to see Targos from the inside. I just hope your fellow soldiers don't draw steel when they see me.~
@41216=~You're one of the heroes of Targos now, Vunarg. I'll make sure they treat you accordingly.~
@41217=~I hadn't even thought about that, to be honest.~
@41218=~Don't worry; I'll just tell them you're a weird-looking gnome.~
@41219=~Do you expect me to fight my own allies just to protect you?~
@41220=~They'll probably just think you're our prisoner.~
@41221=~I appreciate the gesture. Though I wonder what my clan would think if they heard I was a "hero of Targos."~
@41222=~You can always lie.~
@41223=~They'll probably be happier about your victories in battle than your choice of company.~
@41224=~They knew what you were getting into, right?~
@41225=~I don't intend to lie to my clan. They're my people; I owe them the truth. Even if it isn't flattering.~
@41226=~A noble ideal.~
@41227=~I never thought I'd hear that kind of thing from a goblin.~
@41228=~I wouldn't risk it, if I were you. It's not like they'd know if you were lying.~
@41229=~A noble ideal... Well, if you want to think so, I won't argue.~
@41230=~Just because I'm a goblin doesn't mean I feel no responsibility for my clan. I'm not their leader just because I'm the strongest; I'm also their leader because they trust me. I plan on keeping it that way.~
@41231=~I would know.~
@41232=~You're right. Guthma's death will make a good story to tell around the campfire.~
@41233=~They did. I guess I shouldn't worry. They understood why I joined you.~
@41234=~You should. I'm no good to you if I get killed.~
@41235=~Be serious. You might not be in enemy territory right now, but I am.~
@41236=~*I* am your ally, [PRO_RACE]. I've defended you before. I expect you to do the same for me.~
@41237=~I dislike the idea, but perhaps that would be safest. I'm sure that would be easier for you to explain it to your fellow soldiers.~
@41238=~Sounds like a plan.~
@41239=~Yeah, I don't think "Vunarg is a friend of Targos" would fly around here.~
@41240=~Just keep looking sullen and angry, and you'll fit the part.~
@41241=~Probably not, no. I don't think my clan would like the idea of me being a "friend of Targos," either.~
@41242=~Good idea. I'll try to suppress my naturally cheerful personality.~
@41243=~~
@41244=~~
@41245=~~
@41246=~Humans here will not like Vrek. If they attack Vrek, Vrek will fight back.~
@41247=~Why bother? You can regenerate.~
@41248=~I don't think anyone's going to be stupid enough to attack a troll.~
@41249=~I'll vouch for you, Vrek. I'll make sure they understand you're a friend.~
@41250=~Vrek can heal, but Vrek can also die. In big town, humans have flaming oil. Flaming oil hurt. It hurt even if Vrek still wet from river.~
@41251=~*Many* humans stupid enough to attack Vrek, long ago. None live, but humans still try.~
@41252=~Human will never be friends with troll. Maybe we not fight. But never be friend.~
@41253=~Many orc and goblin. Even Vrek cannot eat all.~
@41254=~Drag some along with you, then. I don't mind.~
@41255=~Maybe I'll help you, heh.~
@41256=~Not with that attitude.~
@41257=~How are you liking our deal so far?~
@41258=~Vrek will. Goblin meat not good, but orc is.~
@41259=~Vrek like our deal. Vrek eat well. Vrek will stay.~
@41260=~Ice hurts Vrek's eyes. Temple is too bright. But priest meat is good.~
@41261=~Is it me, or is your Common improving?~
@41262=~Don't worry. The temple is not going to last for much longer.~
@41263=~Try not to remind me about your eating habits, troll.~
@41264=~Vrek is learning. Vrek listening often, learn more Common. Someday talk like human, maybe.~
@41265=~Vrek doesn't want to wait long.~
@41266=~Vrek smell dragon.~
@41267=~Dragon?!~
@41268=~You know what dragon smells like?~
@41269=~I think you're right. That cave up ahead must be their nesting place... but I don't see another way forward. We'll just have to prepare.~
@41270=~I assume a white dragon. They're the most common in Icewind Dale. They're smaller than most dragons, but we should still be careful.~
@41271=~Yes. Vrek know dragon smell. Vrek steal from dragon nest long ago. Dragon nest here, too.~
@41272=~Vrek steal from dragon nest long ago, learn dragon smell. Dragon nest here, too.~
@41273=~Vrek thinks more than one dragon. More than one smell here; more than one dragon.~
@41274=~A whole school for training people how to fight without weapons. That has to be the dumbest idea I've ever heard.~
@41275=~It's far more practical than you might realize. It takes time and effort, but a fist can become much stronger than a sword.~
@41276=~The martial arts are just one aspect of a monastery, Geoffrey. The most important lessons are about self-control and spiritual cultivation; not power.~
@41277=~Maybe you should keep that to yourself. Getting kicked in the teeth is the last thing I need.~
@41278=~I think being able to punch is only part of the point. Monasteries usually have some kind of philosophy; not just combat training.~
@41279=~Yeah. There's a reason there's no such thing as an unarmed army.~
@41280=~I've heard monks can actually get pretty strong with this kind of training.~
@41281=~Hah! Stop a sword with your bare hand, and then *maybe* I'll believe it.~
@41282=~All I see is a bunch of a children pretending to be warriors. Put them in a real fight, and you'll see what happens to them.~
@41283=~Oh, we wouldn't want to *offend* them now, would we? Eh, fine. They can waste their time for all I care.~
@41284=~I've never seen "philosophy" do anything special. As far as I'm concerned, these people are wasting their time.~
@41285=~Aye. I wonder what would happen if these monks ever got in a real fight.~
@41286=~Heh... If one of them can stop a sword with their bare hand, maybe I'd believe it.~
@41287=~It's really neat to see Malavon in the flesh! I never thought I'd get a chance to meet someone famous. This adventure is really taking us all over the place...~
@41288=~You've heard of him?~
@41289=~Infamous, I would say.~
@41290=~Why would you be excited to see Malavon?~
@41291=~I have! A few decades ago, he was down in Dorn's Deep, running some big experiments. A bit of a gnome-killer, though. Not my cup of tea.~
@41292=~That's fair. Bit of a gnome-killer, too.~
@41293=~Well, he's not my *favorite* wizard, of course. He had a habit of enslaving and killing svirfneblins, for one thing. But yes, it's exciting to meet a historical personality.~
@41294=~These woods are a dark place. I can feel the spirits everywhere, lost and confused. I pity them.~
@41295=~It's very quiet here. No birds, no animal tracks. This place is definitely not a home for the living.~
@41296=~I don't like this place. It doesn't feel right. We'd best be out of here soon.~
@41297=~This whole place feels so unnatural... I can feel it in the air itself.~
@41298=~I sense powerful transmutation magic here. Whatever is responsible for the driders, it's the work of a wizard. Probably several. We should hunt them down.~
@41299=~That was so gross... Everything smells *fishy.* And I feel so bad for the thralls. I wonder how long the mind flayers enslaved them?~
@41300=~A cruel slaver has fallen at our hand, and we should be proud. Slavery in all its forms is abhorrent, but to seize control of a being's very *mind*... that is even more horrific.~
@41301=~Yes... Valas would be proud of us for killing these slavers.~
@41302=~Vrek is thinking about the future. After we're done, when the Legion is dead... Where does Vrek go then?~
@41303=~Wherever you want, Vrek. You've earned that much by now.~
@41304=~I'm hoping you won't go back to kidnapping people.~
@41305=~Who says we have to part ways when the Legion is dead? I don't plan on retiring, and as long as I'm on the road, a good fighter is more than welcome by my side.~
@41306=~Take some gold and carve out a place back home. With all the gold we've been earning along the way, you can spend the rest of your days by the river, buying meat from Targos and getting as fat as you please.~
@41307=~Too many choices. Maybe Vrek will go home first, but after, maybe keep walking. Find a new river. Find a new home.~
@41308=~Vrek could build his own legion. Vrek is strong and wise. Vrek could rule Shaengarne, bring many trolls to join him.~
@41309=~If you build a legion of trolls, Vrek, we might end up fighting each other someday.~
@41310=~Does it *have* to be so close to Targos? You know, I hear there's *lots* more food up in the Gloomfrost.~
@41311=~You should steer clear of humans, Vrek. That's a good way to get set on fire.~
@41312=~Maybe Vrek build a legion; maybe not. Vrek has not decided. Someday Vrek will know.~
@41313=~Do not lie to Vrek... Vrek knows the Gloomfrost is cold and empty. Vrek will go someplace warm and wet and rich, and make a new home.~
@41314=~Yes. Maybe Vrek find another place... someplace warm and wet and rich, and safe.~
@41315=~Good idea. Vrek has had a good life on the road. Vrek would like to keep going.~
@41316=~Mm. Good idea. Humans won't like Vrek, but they will like Vrek's gold.~
@41317=~Vrek, do you mind if I take a look at that peculiar growth on your skin?~
@41318=~Why gnome want this?~
@41319=~Well, it's a very unusual mutation-no offense, of course-and I'm sure there's interesting magic in it. Purely curiosity, Vrek. Um... would that be all right?~
@41320=~Gnome can look. Not touch.~
@41321=~I guess that'll have to do. Thank you, Vrek.~
@41322=~Vrek also let gnome touch, if gnome give meat.~
@41323=~Really? Uh... what kind of meat?~
@41324=~Soft.~
@41325=~Um... A-all right. That's a bit creepy. No offense, again. I'll, um... see what I can do.~
@41326=~Veira, may I take a look at your ring?~
@41327=~- You may look -
 - But I must know why -
 - I am not a specimen to be studied -~
@41328=~Uh, right. Not a specimen. I'm just... curious. About the magic in the ring.~
@41329=~- The ring is an anchor -
 - My one tangible connection to this place -
 - If it is damaged -
 - I will be adrift in the sea of another world -~
@41330=~Ah. Probably not the sort of thing I should poke around with, then.~
@41331=~Stay focused, Pairi. We can't have you getting distracted.~
@41332=~What? Oh, yeah, I'm paying attention.~
@41333=~I don't want to be harsh. But you do get distracted fairly often, and adventuring is not friendly to that habit. Whenever we're in a new place, we need to be on alert. All right?~
@41334=~But new places are the most *interesting!* That's where it's easiest to get distracted! And that's where I get a lot of inspiration for my magic, too. It's where I learn things.~
@41335=~I... I understand. If that's how you need to operate, then all right. I'll watch your back for you.~
@41336=~Thank you! And I'm glad I've got a big strong friend to look out for me.~
@41337=~My... my pleasure, Pairi.~
@41338=~I had my doubts about you, Vunarg. But you've been defending the group very well, and... I wanted to thank you for it.~
@41339=~You're welcome. But this is simply practical. Any clan that wishes to survive must act in unison. I need your defense as well.~
@41340=~You will have it.~
@41341=~Good.~
@41342=~And I had my doubts about you, too. I was sure that you would find some excuse to try to kill me someday. Apparently you're more openminded than I thought.~
@41343=~You thought I was going to attack you? Why did you stay?~
@41344=~Because I didn't think you would succeed.~
@41345=~Ha ha! Fair enough.~
@41346=~Heh...~
@41347=~Reig, you've been adventuring a long time, right?~
@41348=~Not really. Until I joined this group, I was just a soldier at home. I've seen a *lot* since then, but... it hasn't been long.~
@41349=~Oh. Well, I thought I'd ask if you had any advice for me. You always seemed like a veteran to me.~
@41350=~Thanks. But I'm not sure what advice I'd give. You're already attentive, eager to learn, easy to get along with... and humble, come to think of it, which is also important... and not always very common. Whatever they taught you at the monastery, I think it was probably pretty good.~
@41351=~But if I think of anything, I'll let you know.~
@41352=~Thank you!~
@41353=~Eyes front, cutthroat.~
@41354=~Mind your own business, boy. I'll look where I want.~
@41355=~I've seen a hundred drunken lechers before you, and you're no different. Keep your eyes off of Pairi.~
@41356=~Oh, is she *yours?* Maybe you should let her pick for herself... I'm sure she'd prefer a *real* man.~
@41357=~She's nobody's, Geoffrey-yours or mine. Pick someone else... someone who'll know what you really are, and won't mind it.~
@41358=~*snort* We're a long way from a tavern. Don't blame me if I'm a little thirsty.~
@41359=~I mean it, Geoffrey. I'm watching you.~
@41360=~Veira, can you tell my future? I'm a little curious. I've never had my fortune told before.~
@41361=~- I need no magic to see it -
 - You live a blessed life -
 - Beauty and charm and innocence -
 - The road will be hard -
 - But you will be as happy as you've always been -
 - Loved by the stars and loved by the world -~
@41362=~Aww... That's really sweet!~
@41363=~- I could not do otherwise -
 - No one could -~
@41364=~How did you come to join the party, Vunarg? I've never heard of a goblin adventurer.~
@41365=~Well, I used to be with the Legion-or rather, the horde; I didn't know about the Legion until later. But the horde treated me and my clan poorly, so when I got the chance to join the group as a mercenary, I took it. Someday I'll go back to my clan with riches and stories to share with them.~
@41366=~So you won't be with us for long?~
@41367=~Why, did you want me to?~
@41368=~I don't see why not. We make a good team, don't we?~
@41369=~We do. But my clan is waiting for me. They are my people and my home.~
@41370=~It doesn't even bother you that I'm a goblin, does it?~
@41371=~No. Why would that matter?~
@41372=~I... could think of a number of reasons. But for you, Pairi, maybe it really doesn't matter. And I see no reason to change that.~
@41373=~Well, I hope you stay with us a long time.~
@41374=~You're a strange creature, Pairi. But I think I prefer it that way.~
@41375=~Ah. Vrek see moon healer brought friends.~
@41376=~We've come for the moonblade, troll! Be assured, we have ways of dealing with you even without the moonblade. Surrender it, or else!~
@41377=~Vrek not scared of you. Only one weapon Vrek fear, and Vrek take!~
@41378=~But our party includes Sersa, a Black Raven Monk. Surely she can enter, even if the rest of us cannot?~
@41379=~No. Sersa is currently only an initiate, not a true monk. She has not yet mastered the Eight Chambers.~
@41380=~I gotta be honest, I'm not really excited about fighting a bunch of driders. Maybe there won't be that many...~
@41381=~And here is my blade. Thank you for helping me recover it. I must reward you.~
@41382=~I have seen your deeds. You have shown unswerving dedication to the fight against evil. My blade was intended for just such a cause. I am grateful to you for helping me retrieve it, but now it is my honor to give it to you to keep. Use it well in our battles to come.~
@41383=~Thank you for your gift, priestess. But if you are coming with us, it is best that you wield the moonblade yourself. It is your weapon of choice, and you deserve it as much as we do. Please take it back.~
@41384=~Very well. If you wish it, I will wield the moonblade.~
@41385=~Isair and Madae have a very strange choice in their headquarters. This whole building is *saturated* in unstable magic. You can even see it oozing out of the walls!~
@41386=~How unstable?~
@41387=~Any idea what's causing it?~
@41388=~I hope the place doesn't come crashing down. While we're in it, anyway.~
@41389=~The Severed Hand used to be a fortress, long ago. I can see why Isair and Madae would choose to set up shop here.~
@41390=~I'm a bit rusty on my history. Didn't it fall apart because of unstable magic back then?~
@41391=~I don't know. All I really know is that it used to be the heart of an elven civilization. Does that mean the place is at risk of falling apart again?~
@41392=~It did. Its leaders created a mythal in an attempt to protect it from an invasion, but something went wrong, and the mythal killed everyone inside. If that mythal is still in place, then the same thing might happen again.~
@41393=~Don't know. But I think the place fell apart a long time ago because of a magical problem of some sort. Maybe the problem is still here.~
@41394=~Are you saying the place is at risk of falling apart again?~
@41395=~Not really. I think this place fell apart before, though, way back when it was an elven fortress. Some magical problem.~
@41396=~I wonder if there's some way to bring it down. I guess we could poke around, figure out where the growths are coming from. Maybe learn more about the history? I don't remember much about the Severed Hand, honestly.~
@41397=~We can probably read about the history somewhere.~
@41398=~Unstable enchantments are difficult to study safely. We should look for a wizard, or whoever is responsible for creating or maintaining it.~
@41399=~It would be a well kept secret, I suspect. Isair and Madae might have created these enchantments themselves.~
@41400=~A nice relaxing read would be very welcome! Makes for a good change of pace from all the killing.~
@41401=~Good thinking. We should look high up, in one of the towers. Wizards LOVE their towers.~
@41402=~I hope not. If the twins spend a lot of their time on building the Legion, maybe they've been neglecting the enchantments here.~
@41403=~That could be good news. Poor maintenance would make it more fragile, and easier to sabotage.~
@41404=~Let's be careful. I don't want this thing collapsing on us.~
@41405=~You might be right. Best we learn more about the magic here.~
@41406=~Could be. Hey, maybe the whole thing will collapse on its own! Problem solved, eh?~
@41407=~I'm not so optimistic. I think the Legion will only end when the twins are dead.~
@41408=~Let's make sure we're out of here before it does.~
@41409=~Perhaps there's a way to sabotage it.~
@41410=~Yeah, probably. Let's hope they don't see us coming.~
@41411=~Good thinking! I guess we could poke around, figure out where the growths are coming from. Maybe learn more about the history? I don't remember much about the Severed Hand, honestly.~
@41412=~That's not good news. Do you know when it might fall apart?~
@41413=~Not yet, but we can probably read more about its history somewhere. Perhaps we can sabotage it somehow. There must be at least one mage on retainer to maintain whatever enchantments are here, so we should be able to wring some information out of them. Then we can start putting together a plan to tear this place down.~
@41414=~- Our time is drawing to a close -
 - Isair and Madae are unlikely to see reason -
 - Too much hatred has clouded their vision -
 - And our journey will end in bloodshed -~
@41415=~The twins chose their fate. We have no responsibility to try to spare them.~
@41416=~Good. Isair and Madae have long since earned it.~
@41417=~I'm not optimistic, but what *would* let us avoid bloodshed?~
@41418=~You don't seem thrilled about killing the twins.~
@41419=~- There was a time when we could have changed them -
 - Made them a force for good -
 - Persecution has changed them -
 - And I weep for their lost innocence -~
@41420=~You give them too much credit. Plenty of people have suffered like them *without* starting a legion to crush their enemies.~
@41421=~You think it's too late to resolve things peacefully? I'd like to think there's still a chance.~
@41422=~It makes little difference now. Whatever they used to be or could have been, right now they're a threat, and they need to be put down.~
@41423=~You really think they could have been changed to be good? I find it hard to imagine.~
@41424=~- I believe so -
 - But perhaps it does not matter -
 - They have fallen too far -
 - Peace is no longer an option -~
@41425=~- The road has forked many times -
 - Long ago we may have chosen a more peaceful road -
 - But eventually there is only one path left -
 - The path of blood and iron -~
@41426=~Disappointing. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I haven't seen much evidence the twins could be won over.~
@41427=~So violence is our only option?~
@41428=~- We will not be able to save them -
 - But blades are not our only tools -
 - Any words that could sway them -
 - Even for a moment -
 - Could save our lives -~
@41429=~Any ideas? I'm open to suggestions.~
@41430=~- You are right -
 - Suffering can do many things to people -
 - Inspiring them to feel empathy -
 - Or invoking their rage -
 - Isair and Madae are the latter -~
@41431=~- But they could have been better -
 - Just as those who did learn empathy from their struggles -
 - Could have been worse -
 - Had their lives been easier -~
@41432=~But the twins *did* turn out bad, and those are the people we're dealing with now. A hypothetical past doesn't change the present reality. We have to put them down, Veira.~
@41433=~Maybe so. But what else could we do? It's a bit late to resolve things without violence.~
@41434=~I don't particularly care. Isair and Madae need to die. I've been looking forward to killing them for a long time.~
@41435=~- Perhaps this is the way of things -
 - The road has forked many times -
 - But eventually there is only one path left -
 - The path of blood and iron -~
@41436=~- Peace is no longer an option -
 - But blades are not our only tools -
 - Any words that could sway them -
 - Even for a moment -
 - Could save our lives -~
@41437=~What do you have in mind?~
@41438=~I wouldn't waste time trying to figure out a way to influence them. Our time and energy are better spent preparing for a battle.~
@41439=~Hm. I don't mind the twins dying, but saving *our* lives is definitely a priority of mine.~
@41440=~- Their actions have damned them -
 - But blades are not our only tools -
 - Any words that could sway them -
 - Even for a moment -
 - Could save our lives -~
@41441=~The twins have shown themselves very confident, and very convinced of their own ideas. Doubt is not something they will easily feel.~
@41442=~If we're going to put something in their hearts, a dagger would work much better than "doubt."~
@41443=~~
@41444=~- Perhaps you are right -
 - The odds of swaying them are slim -
 - This will surely end in violence -
 - When the time comes for bloodshed -
 - We must be ready for anything -~
@41445=~- Perhaps we could stall them -
 - Or shake their confidence -
 - Trick them into a debate -
 - Or even appeal to a better part of themselves -
 - A part that still wishes to do good -~
@41446=~Shaking their confidence doesn't sound realistic. Judging by our few encounters with them, doubt is an alien feeling to them.~
@41447=~A moral argument would be difficult to make.~
@41448=~I suppose I could invoke my non-human heritage, try to challenge their claim to be defending people like me. But they might just see me as a traitor for it.~
@41449=~The closest thing to a bluff I can think of is to pretend the unstable magic I've seen around the Severed Hand is falling apart. But they'd have little reason to trust my words.~
@41450=~You know, for all of their claims to be defending the half-breeds of the world, I've not really seen them do much to protect anyone. If I challenged them to name something good they've done for the people they claim to represent, do you think that might shake them?~
@41451=~- It might only provoke them -
 - But perhaps it could distract them instead -
 - Defeating us would require their focus -
 - We could weaken that focus -
 - If we planted a thought inside their minds -
 - A thought they could not shake -~
@41452=~- They have made their future -
 - They have cast aside ways to make peace -
 - But our future is not yet made -
 - Our choices remain open -~
@41453=~What other choices do we even have at this point?~
@41454=~I have no intention of changing course. The twins deserve to die. They *need* to die.~
@41455=~Let's say there's a way to spare the twins. Something that could end the Legion's threat without violence. Would the odds of success be better than simply killing them? If not, should we put all of Icewind Dale in jeopardy just to save two lives?~
@41456=~I see only one path ahead, Veira, and it ends with victory.~
@41457=~- Surely not -
 - But saving their lives is not what I suggest -
 - Our words can be weapons -
 - If they are sharp enough to pierce the skin -
 - The smallest tool may turn our defeat into victory -
 - And we must not fail -~
@41458=~- There may be a way -
 - A way to instill doubt in their hearts -
 - To shake their resolve and buy time -
 - The only question is how -~
@41459=~- Perhaps not -
 - But words cost us little and could do so much -
 - We must try to find something -
 - Anything -
 - To sway their clouded minds -~
@41460=~- You are right -
 - But words cost us little and could do so much -
 - We must try to find something -
 - Anything -
 - To sway their clouded minds -~
@41461=~- Their claims are merely excuses -
 - A way to justify their pursuit of power -
 - But part of them may truly believe in their own words -
 - That part of them will not save them -
 - But it may save us -~
@41462=~- I pray that you will succeed -
 - We may not save their lives -
 - But perhaps it will spare our own. -~
@41463=~- A pity that you are right -
 - There may have been a time when we could have changed them -
 - But that was long ago -
 - Long, long ago -~
@41464=~It looks like we're almost done. Soon enough the Legion will be headless, its allies should disperse, and we will be the saviors of the Ten Towns.~
@41465=~Exciting, isn't it?~
@41466=~Assuming we don't die in the process.~
@41467=~How does it feel to be a hero to the human world?~
@41468=~Do you still plan on going back to your home clan? Bring them all the riches you've collected?~
@41469=~It's hard to believe. The day we met at the horde fortress seems so long ago.~
@41470=~It does. We've been through so much together, more than I *ever* expected to see in my life. And now I'm here. In some bizarre fortress, fighting enemies from all across Faerun and even the outer planes. My friends in my home clan seem like children now. There's so much they've never seen.~
@41471=~And you'll be there to educate them. Tell them tales and teach lessons.~
@41472=~You're welcome to stay with the group, even after the Legion is done. Send some treasure back home and keep adventuring.~
@41473=~True.~
@41474=~You'll be a legend in both worlds, goblin and human.~
@41475=~I do. But I have concerns. The wealth will make my clan a target, and they're not big enough to defend themselves from all the tribes that will try to seize our wealth. I might send them gold in small portions, or maybe hire mercenaries first. My clan needs to grow before it can safely hold the coin I've earned. I can protect them myself-if a whole tribe of bugbears descended on my clan, I could easily slay them all single-handedly-but I won't be there forever. They'll need to be strong even without me.~
@41476=~You take a lot of responsibility for your people. I respect that.~
@41477=~If hiring mercenaries to defend them is an option, you might not need to go back home to keep them safe. Why not stay with the party, and keep earning coin with us?~
@41478=~Sire some children. They're going to be legends in their own right. They'll be able to defend your clan when you're gone.~
@41479=~I'll miss you.~
@41480=~I do. And I appreciate your words. My clan means everything to me.~
@41481=~I'll consider it.~
@41482=~Well, on the off chance you ever want to live a goblin life, my clan will always welcome you. But that's for another day. Come... let's finish the job. We have no future while the twins still breathe.~
@41483=~But I should stop worrying about the future. Isair and Madae are still alive. I need my attention focused on them. When they're dead, then I can think about my life after the Legion.~
@41484=~I intend to. But a child isn't always like its parents. I hope my children are strong and smart, but there's no guarantee.~
@41485=~More than a few dynasties have collapsed because of that.~
@41486=~Best make a lot of them. At least some of them will turn out good.~
@41487=~I think they will be. They'll inherit at least a part of your abilities.~
@41488=~And goblin clans are much less stable than a human kingdom. My clan may grow weak and crumble within a generation. There's no way of knowing for certain.~
@41489=~A decent plan. I just hope they turn their energies towards fighting their real rivals, instead of each other.~
@41490=~Perhaps. But even if they do, infighting may doom the clan. I just hope their turn their energies towards fighting their real rivals, instead of each other.~
@41491=~I honestly do not mind. I used to have misgivings about aiding humans, but it's not like my actions have been bad for my clan. Quite the opposite, considering the resources I can give them now. Who could criticize me back home? I have more battle experience and gold than anyone I'd ever met back then. I'm richer and stronger than Guthma now. By a lot.~
@41492=~I think we have good odds. Isair and Madae will be far stronger than any enemy we've faced before, but we have ample opportunity to sabotage their fortress and plan for battle.~
@41493=~But that will require great focus. There is little margin for error, and we must make the most of the time we have. Let's get going.~
@41494=~No. It feels strange. I don't regret joining the group, but when I did, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I thought I'd just be fighting Guthma, and that would be it. But it was going well, so I decided to stay a bit longer, earn a little more coin. Then the airship crash left me with no way home. *Then* I started to see just how big the Legion was, and how much we had ahead of us.~
@41495=~The past few weeks have been a rush. It actually feels like most of my life has been with you. Like I've lived multiple lifetimes since we met. I've barely had time to think.~
@41496=~And now I'm here. In some bizarre fortress, fighting enemies from all across Faerun and even the outer planes. My friends in my home clan seem like children now. There's so much they've never seen.~
@41497=~I will. But my home will always feel small to me, I think. My clan wasn't the largest in the area, and the treasure I bring back won't make it as large as some of the others. If anything, the treasure will make my clan a target for raids. I have no doubt I can crush any of our enemies, but it will take lots of labor to make my clan strong enough to live without me.~
@41498=~I should stop thinking about it. Isair and Madae are still alive. I need my attention focused on them. When they're dead, then I can think about my life after the Legion.~
@41499=~I like the idea. But the treasure will make my clan a target for raids, and my clan isn't big enough to defend itself on its own. Maybe I'll send them only modest amounts at a time, and maybe spend some of it to hire mercenaries first. But if they can't hold off the bigger clans, I will have to go back home and defend it myself. That's the only way I'd know that they were safe.~
@41500=~I've just got a lot on my mind. The world is going to change when Isair and Madae are dead. Everything is going to change.~
@41501=~I don't think I mind that. I used to have misgivings about aiding humans, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished in this group. Who could criticize me back home? I have more battle experience and gold than anyone I'd ever met back then. I'm richer and stronger than Guthma now. By a lot.~
@41502=~Being a legend. It's a very different life... not something I'd ever have expected. But I think it's a good thing. I'm proud.~
@41503=~And I'm grateful, as well. I could not have come this far without you.~
@41504=~If this is the culmination of my training, then I could not have asked for more. This is one of the largest groups of slaves our order has ever freed.~
@41505=~I am glad to see the slaves walk free. It lifts my spirits, and I needed it. Fighting the Legion has always felt like an impossible task. There is so much evil here, and so much power behind it. Sometimes I've wondered how we were ever able to succeed against them. Whenever we bring down a major enemy, there has always been another, stronger enemy waiting right behind it.~
@41506=~Like climbing a mountain, but you never reach the peak.~
@41507=~I find it encouraging, actually. Every enemy we bring down is a reminder of our own strength. The enemy is massive and sometimes it seems endless, but we have always been able to handle it.~
@41508=~But Isair and Madae are the end, and they are finally within reach. The Legion is running out of enemies to get in our way.~
@41509=~I know the feeling. It really is good to see the slaves escape their bonds. A perfect reminder of what we're fighting for.~
@41510=~Precisely. But seeing all those people finally free... it gives me strength and hope. Our fight against the Legion is not endless, and our deeds are making a difference.~
@41511=~That's all I've ever wanted, really. To make the world a better place.~
@41512=~I suppose so. I just feel so relieved to see the fruits of our labor. I have taken no pleasure in seeing an enemy fall, but knowing that these people are finally free... it gives me strength and hope. We aren't just fighting the Legion. We're making a difference.~
@41513=~Yes. It won't be long before our labors are done... replaced by some other task, something smaller and quieter. I look forward to a life after the Legion. It will be simpler, like the life I knew before.~
@41514=~Heh... I make it sound like it's so long ago, my life before we first met. But it does feel like years have passed in these short few weeks. I never could have foreseen how far we would go, or how much we would do.~
@41515=~But now I am seeing the fruits of labor. All these people are finally free. Our actions are making a difference.~
@41516=~Freedom. A more perfect word I've never found.~
@41517=~As bleak as things seem in this twisted citadel, I am so glad that you brought me with you. I cannot thank you enough for all that you've taught me.~
@41518=~Why, thank you, Pairi. You've been an excellent student.~
@41519=~You give yourself too little credit, Pairi. You're the one who is responsible for everything you've learned.~
@41520=~Uh... you're welcome. Where is this coming from, Pairi?~
@41521=~You're welcome. But we really must focus now. Isair and Madae still live, and we are in dangerous territory.~
@41522=~Thank *you* for helping us kill our enemies.~
@41523=~Nowhere in particular. I just feel like the world is so much grander than I ever imagined back in the village. I've never been so excited to explore the world!~
@41524=~We shall. Isair and Madae are just one chapter of our lives. We have so much farther to go together.~
@41525=~I think I might retire after this. I've had enough adventure to last ten lifetimes.~
@41526=~In 200 years, you will be one of the greatest sorcerers the world has ever known. And you'll *still* be a child at heart.~
@41527=~Good luck, Pairi. It's a weird, weird world out there.~
@41528=~Of course! I do my best... I just feel like the world is so much grander than I ever imagined back in the village. We've seen some dark things, but also a lot of beauty. I've never been so excited to explore the world!~
@41529=~Aww, thank you! I just feel like the world is so much grander than I ever imagined back in the village... We've seen dark things, but also a lot of beauty. I've never been so excited to explore the world!~
@41530=~I do my best. I just feel like the world is so much grander than I ever imagined back in the village! We've seen dark things, but also beautiful things. I've never been so excited to explore the world!~
@41531=~Good! I like myself this way. And learning magic is always fun.~
@41532=~I'm happy to hear it! Where do you think we'll go after this?~
@41533=~I have no idea.~
@41534=~It could be nice to go back to Chult. Someplace we won't get frostbite.~
@41535=~I've never been to Calimshan before.~
@41536=~Definitely Kara-Tur. I've heard so much about the land.~
@41537=~Someplace no one else has ever gone before. Deep north, past the Gloomfrost.~
@41538=~I was thinking of sailing. Don't know where. Maybe we'll discover a new island someplace.~
@41539=~The Sword Coast would be a nice break from Icewind Dale.~
@41540=~The Underdark.~
@41541=~How about another plane?~
@41542=~Ooh, wow! That would be *very* interesting. Sure, I'd love to. Maybe when we're done here, we can pick out which one.~
@41543=~Really? Back to the Underdark? That sounds terrifying.~
@41544=~We don't have to, you know.~
@41545=~We'll be prepared. Don't worry.~
@41546=~Another place, then.~
@41547=~Oh, I can handle it. But yeah, someplace else might be nice. Maybe when we're done here, we can figure it out.~
@41548=~You're right; we can handle it. I was just a little surprised, is all.~
@41549=~Sounds like a plan. I can't wait to see it!~
@41550=~Well, we have our whole lives to figure it out!~
@41551=~It's so strange to see such an evil form of martial arts... back at the monastery, I always assumed a monk's talents were tied with benevolence and self-control.~
@41552=~There are many paths to one's development, not all of them like yours. But this particular variant is new to me.~
@41553=~I guess hatred also helps you punch pretty good.~
@41554=~I think they are. These monks were powerful, but they were still following the wrong path.~
@41555=~Yeah. So much anger... I'm surprised *anyone* found Xvim appealing as a god.~
@41556=~Maybe. I don't know where they got their skills, but it really feels like this kind of school lacks discipline.~
@41557=~Iyachtu Xvim is very petty to desecrate these statues... Posing them to worship him, just to sate his own ego. It's a pathetic display... even *aside* from the inherent blasphemy of it all.~
@41558=~What just *happened?* Did we really fight a god? And not die?~
@41559=~Damn... I don't believe it... We just beat down a GOD! Ha ha! Oh, I will *never* get tired of telling this story. Not 'til the day I die.~
@41560=~Wait 'til Svaltid hears about this!~
@41561=~Great... I bet Xvim is going to be haunting me for the rest of my life. But it was worth it. We spat in the face of a god and lived to tell the tale.~
@41562=~No one is *ever* going to believe this story.~
@41563=~It's terrifying to see such a raw example of evil power... but very gratifying, I must admit, to put a wicked god in his place.~
@41564=~Vrek is proud. Even a god can't stop us.~
@41565=~- I have no words for what I have seen -
 - Only amazement that we still exist -~
@41566=~Wow. Heh heh... that was the worst experience of my *life!* Well, we were lucky we only had to fight a weak child god. Had we fought his father Bane, we would have been in big trouble.~
@41567=~Oh, of course! Sorry. I'll stay focused. Maybe afterwards I can figure out what comes next...~
@41568=~Oh... I'll miss you! I'll make sure to visit you often, wherever you do settle down. Maybe I could bring you back some souvenirs and stories. I wonder where I'll go...~
@41569=~...also, if Sersa completes all eight of the chambers herself, without anyone else in the group doing chambers for her, she will officially be a monk of the Black Raven order.~
@41570=~...It is finally time for me to attempt the Eight Chambers. I am a little scared. I hope I am prepared.~
@41571=~You are a Black Raven monk, right? Have you not already completed the Chambers?~
@41572=~What is there to be afraid of? Isn't this just another form of training to become a monk?~
@41573=~What do you know of the trials we will face in the Eight Chambers?~
@41574=~Let us get to it, then.~
@41575=~No, I have not yet completed the Eight Chambers. I am still an initiate, not a true monk.~
@41576=~To become an official monk of the Black Raven order, I need to clear all eight of the chambers myself. If one of you clears any of the chambers in my stead, I will stay an initiate.~
@41577=~The Eight Chambers are not mere training; they are a test, and a lethal one. If we fail at the test, we die.~
@41578=~I know that the first chamber requires us to pull switches in a certain order, but the exact order is kept secret. The second chamber also requires us to do something in a certain order.~
@41579=~The other six chambers simply require us to defeat all the foes in the chamber. The enemies in the third chamber can cast lightning spells, and supposedly a certain panel on the floor will protect us from the lightning.~
@41580=~The enemies in the fourth chamber will explode, but there is apparently a switch that can prevent them from exploding. The foes in the fifth chamber resist punches and kicks, but the fire traps in the chamber will still hurt them.~
@41581=~The sixth chamber is supposedly filled with spiders. I am not looking forward to that. The seventh chamber requires us to knock out and incapacitate the enemies, which doesn't sound so bad.~
@41582=~The final chamber is apparently the hardest, where we have to fight enemies in a room filled with flames.~
@41583=~Murder innocents? *Never!* I fear we cannot defeat you, but I will try before we dare commit murder!~
@41584=~Killing slaves is against the teachings of our order. We are to *free* the slaves, not kill them!~
@41585=~*Sigh* Does this group have any idea what it's getting into here?~
@41586=~I can certainly see why you were chosen to be the leader of your order. You would rather die a hideous monstrosity than give up your ideals. I wish I were that resolute.~
@41587=~We will never ally with you, fell god! I fear we cannot defeat you, but I will certainly try!~
@41588=~We will cleanse this place, fell god! I fear we cannot defeat you, but I will certainly try!~
@41589=~And I see you have the ghost from the inn in your company. You are more alike with Myrkulytes than you think.~
@41590=~- I would have nothing to do -
 - With a Lord -
 - Who sees those who perished -
 - As little more than tools -~
@41591=~- And I foresee a time -
 - When "my" Lord -
 - Will be replaced with another -
 - Who will let the dead rest in peace -~
@41592=~I will not have you say such blasphemy of your own ruler, spirit. Mind that Myrkul's power can make you cower before me at a moment's notice.~
@41593=~Huh. I just realized I never saw an orog priest before. Pretty impressive. I wonder why there aren't more of them.~
@41594=~I am the last orog priest you will ever see, pathetic goblin.~
@41595=~Vrek smell cat.~
@41596=~Cats? Where?~
@41597=~You smell like cat.~
@41598=~Oh... ah, yes. I am a druid; I am around animals often.~
@41599=~Druid did not smell like cat before.~
@41600=~Well, if you think so, Vrek. Anyway, it's great to see the heroes of Targos again!~
@41601=~- This realm is familiar to me -
 - Once I was drawn here while the sun was shining -~
@41602=~This water green. Not safe to swim in.~
@41603=~Oh, wow! Look up! The upper part of the tower is still intact, floating above these fragments. I wonder how we'll get up there?~
@41604=~When we asked Sersa about the trials we would face in the Eight Chambers, she told us the following:

I know that the first chamber requires us to pull switches in a certain order, but the exact order is kept secret. The second chamber also requires us to do something in a certain order.

The other six chambers simply require us to defeat all the foes in the chamber. The enemies in the third chamber can cast lightning spells, and supposedly a certain panel on the floor will protect us from the lightning.

The enemies in the fourth chamber will explode, but there is apparently a switch that can prevent them from exploding. The foes in the fifth chamber resist punches and kicks, but the fire traps in the chamber will still hurt them.

The sixth chamber is supposedly filled with spiders. I am not looking forward to that. The seventh chamber requires us to knock out and incapacitate the enemies, which doesn't sound so bad.

The final chamber is apparently the hardest, where we have to fight enemies in a room filled with flames.~
@41605=~Sersa has mastered one of the Eight Chambers.~
@41606=~Sersa has mastered all of the Eight Chambers.~
@41607=~Now that she has mastered the Eight Chambers, Sersa has become a true monk of the Black Raven order.~
@41608=~And congratulations to Sersa in particular - you are no longer an initiate, but a true member of our order.~
@41609=~Yes.. thank you. The Eight Chambers turned out less difficult than I had feared.~
@41610=~I have *never* heard a lemure speak before. Normally they are silent and obey the telepathic commands of more powerful devils. But this one is not responding to mine. And I sense it is *far* more powerful than most lemures. Let us listen to what it has to say.~
@41611=~WHAT!? Isair and Madae are half-devils, yet they employ *tanar'ri* here?~
@41612=~We will find a way to slay this glabrezu. I care little for these pathetic slaves, but the tanar'ri must die.~
@41613=~Yes. The magic binding me forces me to only fight if certain conditions are met. Were it not for that, I would kill you on sight, baatezu.~
@41614=~Oh! I just remembered - while we are here, we should be on the lookout for Ormis Dohor, the old archimandrite of the monastery. When Dolon came to the monastery, he requested that Ormis come here, to the Severed Hand. And Ormis agreed to go... but we never heard back from him.~
@41615=~Now that I think about it, it is possible something really bad happened to him. If he came here, he would have seen the slavery and other horrors that are happening here. He would have fought back... did he get killed? Or imprisoned?~
@41616=~We should look for him. If he is still alive, he would be an excellent ally.~
@41617=~*This* is what happened to you, Ormis? That's horrifying! We have to find a way to return you to your normal form. You are the greatest monk of our order who still lives.~
@41618=~Perhaps. But you appear to have come a long way since you joined our order, Sersa. You likely are not far below me. And while I am in this state, you certainly are more powerful than me.~
@41619=~Sersa suggested that we might find Ormis Dohor, the former archimandrite of the Black Raven monastery, in the Severed Hand, and that he might prove a very helpful ally.~
@41620=~No mercy for worshippers of the tanar'ri Lolth! One day, the legions of the Nine Hells will conquer the Demonweb Pits, and none of Lolth's minions will survive!~
@41621=~I'd like to see them try. Those baatezu would be fools to charge right into our mistress's web. Kill them all!~
@41622=~This gelugon appears to be the kind of devil I was looking for - one who can promote me.~
@41623=~Great Yxbudur'zmutkimdu, I come in search of a deal. What task would you have me do in exchange for my promotion to cornugon?~
@41624=~What in Mephistopheles' name is an abishai doing traveling around with mere mortals?! Fine, then. Bring me the flesh of a powerful tanar'ri, and I might consider promoting you.~
@41625=~I can do that, mighty Yxbudur'zmutkimdu, but I must first request that you *swear* to promote me when the task is done.~
@41626=~Has traveling with these mortals given you a demonic taint?! You do not make additional requests of your superiors! You take their offer as is or die!~
@41627=~Actually, according to infernal law, devils are only inferiors to greater devils from the same layer, and to archdevils. I am from Avernus and you are not, and neither of us are archdevils, so the chain of command must be decided by brute force.~
@41628=~Such insolence for a mere white abishai to make such requests! I worked and killed for hundreds of years to be promoted from white to red, and you think you can go all the way to cornugon status for just a single task?!~
@41629=~Argh, and I thought *you* were the insolent one... fine, then. Brute force it is!~
@41630=~...You have not bested me yet, abishai. But I offer you another deal: slay all these mortals, and I swear I will promote you to a cornugon.~
@41631=~So now you swear to do it? Very well. I have been waiting to use you mortals as tools to my promotion, and it seems I need you no longer. Farewell.~
@41632=~Damn you, Xhaan. You will pay for this treachery!~
@41633=~If you fight all of us, you die. You cannot defeat the rest of us by yourself.~
@41634=~Have you considered that even if you kill us and this devil promotes you to a cornugon, he could just demote you to a lemure immediately after? Without us, you have little bargaining power over him!~
@41635=~Do not turn on us, Xhaan! You still need our help to defeat Isair and Madae.~
@41636=~If I die here, I return to the Nine Hells and can continue to seek promotion there. It is not an enormous setback, and the assurance that I will be promoted if I can kill you mortals is too lucrative, even if the chance I am successful is low.~
@41637=~Revenge on Isair and Madae is the least of my concerns at this minute. If I can kill you mortals and get promoted here, then my time trapped on this plane will be the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.~
@41638=~Actually, yes, that is a concern. Yxbudur'zmutkimdu, I cannot take this deal as long as that is a possibility.~
@41639=~Then I offer you one last deal. You seem to rely on these mortals too much. If you can bring me to near defeat by yourself, without any help from these mortals, I swear to give you the promotion you seek. But if you fail, I will consume you.~
@41640=~I accept.~
@41641=~I hope you can do this by yourself, Xhaan.~
@41642=~We cannot let you do this by yourself, Xhaan! You need our help to defeat this devil!~
@41643=~This is the best deal I will get, and you mortals will not allow it?! Then you will die!~
@41644=~HAHAHAHAH! My deal never stated I couldn't get help from my own allies!~
@41645=~There goes the insolent abishai. Now to finish off their mortal lackeys...~
@41646=~ENOUGH! How does a mere white abishai possess such power? Very well, I will give you the promotion you so desperately desire. Hold still...~
@41647=~There! Very good. And now my mortals and I might as well finish you off while you are weak. We cannot have you turning on us later on.~
@41648=~GAH, I forgot to include a clause in the deal stating you could not attack me afterwards! That was a mistake...~
@41649=~Our deal stated that the mortals would not interfere! You have broken our deal! I will consume you all!~
