//Some translators have asked to revise vanilla IWD2 strings. If you would like to do this, put the revised strings here.
// The TRA reference number of the strings should be equal to 100000 + the original strref number. So if you want to modify
// string number 35473, write:
// @135473=~~
// and put the revised string in between the ~’s.
