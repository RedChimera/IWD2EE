            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Icewind Dale 2: Enhanced Edition is a compilation of tweaks and fixes for Icewind Dale 2, enhancing the
                game in a variety of ways. Classes, spells, items, creatures, and encounters are made more
                interesting.IWD2EE changes over 300 spells and over 1,000 items, and it adds over 90 new spells, almost
                200 new items, over 30 new feats, and several NPCs that can join the party. The mod fixes many of the
                big issues with the original Icewind Dale 2: you no longer have to do large amounts of backtracking to
                complete certain areas, enemies in Heart of Fury Mode are empowered in interesting ways rather than just
                having lots of HP, and you can revise the experience system so you won't get zero experience for killing
                enemies late in the game.</p>
            <p>The big changes described above are only applied if you install certain components - Class Revisions,
                Spell Revisions, Item Revisions and Creature Revisions are the biggest ones. It is highly recommended
                that you install these.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Unzip all files into your IWD2 folder.</li>
                <li>Double-click on the Setup-iwd2ee.exe application.</li>
                <li>The WeiDu window will pop up. Follow the prompt and WeiDu will install the mod on your game. This
                    can also reinstall or uninstall the mod.</li>
                <li>In the IWD2 folder will appear a new program: IWD2EE.exe. Start the game by clicking on it. If you
                    start the game via IWD2.exe, the game will not work right.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you are using any mods other than IWD2EE, you should also install the IWD2EE mod compatibility patch
                which comes with IWD2EE. Install the patch after IWD2EE and after all other mods.</p>

                <h3>1. IWD2EE Core</h3>
                <p>This component must be installed for any other component to be installed. It includes various
                    quality of life changes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Load times are much faster.</li>
                    <li>IWD2EE includes built-in widescreen compatibility, making the Widescreen Mod unnecessary. DO
                        NOT INSTALL THE WIDESCREEN MOD WITH IWD2EE; IT WILL CRASH THE GAME. When you start IWD2EE, a
                        menu opens that lets you set the game to a higher resolution. Note that higher resolution
                        settings do not apply to menus; they only apply when you load a save game. I personally
                        recommend a resolution at 600p or 768p height to make the in-game UI take up the full height
                        of your screen, and to keep the text somewhat readable. For 21:9 and other ultrawide
                        displays, you can set a custom resolution (like 1835x768 or 1433x600) in the ddraw.ini file
                        in the [iwd2] section.</li>
                    <li>IWD2EE includes the ddraw fix program unless you already had one installed. This should
                        improve performance.</li>
                    <li>Scrolling the screen should be smoother on some devices.</li>
                    <li>It is possible to scroll with the middle mouse button.</li>
                    <li>There is now a quickloot button.</li>
                    <li>Right-clicking a spell or innate ability on the actionbar brings up its description (though
                        most innate abilities don't have descriptions unless Class Revisions is installed).</li>
                    <li>You can now go through dialogue as fast as you want; there's no longer a brief delay each
                        time you choose a dialogue option.</li>
                    <li>The time it takes to detect traps is reduced.</li>
                    <li>The character record screen includes a Reform Party button.</li>
                    <li>The options screen includes a button to access the new IEex Options menu (currently it
                        includes an option to alter the fog of war so that it doesn't flicker).</li>
                    <li>If a party member has enough experience to level up multiple times, you can choose how many
                        times they level up at a time. This also allows you to divide the level ups among multiple
                        classes (though you'll have to go through the level up process once for each class).</li>
                    <li>Scrolls are highlighted in green when a wizard is selected who doesn't know the spell.</li>
                    <li>If you do not have the vanilla option to rest until healed enabled, characters heal a number
                        of HP equal to their level on rest, rather than only healing 1 HP.</li>
                    <li>As long as you have the console enabled in IWD2's normal config menu, cheat keys will be
                        enabled automatically without needing to enter a command.</li>
                    <li>For modders, IWD2EE includes several new opcodes, and offers the ability to run Lua code
                        in-game via the console or various hooks (and some of the new opcodes can call custom Lua
                        functions), as well as a limited ability to modify the GUI. This opens up many possibilities
                        for modding.</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="classrev">

                <h3>2. Class Revisions</h3>
                <p>This component revises the game's classes to make warriors, barbarians, and rogues much more
                    viable, and it adds over 30 new feats to the game. This component is most balanced when combined
                    with the Spell Revisions component.</p>

                <h4>Barbarians</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Barbarian rage now grants immunity to fear, hopelessness, stun, paralysis, sleep, and
                        unconsciousness.</li>
                    <li>Barbarians start gaining damage resistance at level 2 rather than level 11, and their
                        damage resistance from their class is doubled if they're wearing medium armor (hide
                        armor or chain mail).</li>
                    <li>Barbarian Rage now keeps improving after level 20.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Bards</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bard songs should be more useful now. They're also spread out over more levels and scale
                        with levels so bards no longer reach their peak at level 11.</li>
                    <li>The songs can stack, but only if multiple bards sing at the same time.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Bard songs:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Level 1: The Tale of Currant Strongheart:</strong> +1 to hit and damage and
                        immunity to fear and hopelessness. Gains another +1 to hit and damage at levels 10, 25
                        and 40.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Level 3: The Song of Kaudies:</strong> All allies are immune to harmful
                        sound-based spells and abilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Level 5: Tymora's Melody:</strong> +1 luck, +2 to saving throws and rogue
                        skills. Gives another +1 to luck and +2 to saving throws and rogue skills at levels 15
                        and 35.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Level 9: The Siren's Yearning:</strong> All enemies must make a Will save or be
                        stunned for 1 round or until they take damage. The save DC is equal to the bard's level.
                        This song also imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to Will saves for 10 rounds, every round.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Level 13: The War Chant of Sith:</strong> +2 generic armor bonus, physical
                        damage resistance of 3/-, and 3 HP healed every round. Increases to +4 AC, 6/- damage
                        resistance, and 6 HP healed every round at level 25.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Level 20: The Ballad of Three Heroes:</strong> +5 spell resistance, 5/-
                        resistance to all forms of magical damage, and the effects of the Tale of Curran
                        Strongheart, Tymora's Melody, and the War Chant of Sith. Increases to +10 spell
                        resistance and 10/- resistance to magical damage at level 28.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Creature Revisions also makes it so enemies early on use more sound-based spells and
                    abilities (such as harpy wails in Chapter 1), which makes the Song of Kaudies more useful.
                </p>
                <p>As in PnP, bards can, on certain level ups, replace one of their lower level spells with
                    another spell of the same level.</p>
                <h4>Clerics</h4>
                <p>Clerics are not changed much by Class Revisions, but Spell Revisions improves the spontaneous
                    casting and domain systems.</p>
                <h4>Druids</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Druids get a new set of shapeshifting forms.</li>
                    <li>The abilities of each form scale with the druid's level.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Druid shapeshifting forms:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Level 5: Winter Wolf</li>
                    <li>Level 7: Polar Bear</li>
                    <li>Level 9: Giant Viper</li>
                    <li>Level 11: Salamander or Frost Salamander</li>
                    <li>Level 13: Shambling Mound</li>
                    <li>Level 15: Fire, Water, Earth or Air Elemental</li>
                    <li>Level 40: Black Dragon (Dragon Shape)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The druid shapeshifting feats are also changed. They now allow druids to shapeshift into
                    Blink Dogs, Rhinocerous Beetles, and a swarm of insects as in the Creeping Doom spell.</p>
                <h4>Monks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monks now get much faster and more accurate unarmed attacks, and their attack damage
                        progresses more logically.</li>
                    <li>Their base damage caps at 1d8+5, but they start with 2 attacks per round and gain an
                        additional attack per round every 3 levels (up to 18 attacks per round at level 49).
                    </li>
                    <li>Their Deflect Arrows ability now lets them take no damage from the first missile attack
                        that would hit them each round.</li>
                    <li>Wholeness of Body now restores HP equal to the character's monk level * their Wisdom
                        bonus, and can be used once per 7 levels.</li>
                    <li>Quivering Palm can affect enemies higher level than the monk, and monks gain an
                        additional use of Quivering Palm every 6 levels after level 15.</li>
                    <li>Monks also get Abundant Step at level 10, a teleportation effect.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, monk orders no longer limit multiclassing, and they have extra abilities.</p>
                <h5>Monk of the Old Order:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>2nd level: The monk now adds their Wisdom bonus again to the DC of Stunning Attack.</li>
                    <li>18th level: The monk now adds their Wisdom bonus again to the DC of Quivering Palm.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Monk of the Broken Ones:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>2nd level: The monk gains one use of Lay on Hands per day. Any level that would give the
                        monk a use of Wholeness of Body instead gives them another use of Lay on Hands. When
                        used by a Monk of the Broken Ones, Lay on Hands restores the same amount of HP as
                        Wholeness of Body (monk level * Wisdom bonus) but can be used on other creatures as
                        well.</li>
                    <li>6th level: The monk gains 2/- resistance to all physical damage. Another 1/- resistance
                        is gained every 4 levels thereafter.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Monk of the Dark Moon:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>2nd level: The monk gains a sneak attack bonus of 1d6. For every 4 additional monk
                        levels after level 2, the monk gains another 1d6 sneak attack damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Fighters</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fighters get +1 to damage every 5 levels and +5% critical hit chance every 10 levels,
                        and can get Greater Weapon Focus in a weapon at level 8 and Greater Weapon
                        Specialization at level 12.</li>
                    <li>All warriors get better saving throws and stronger attacks.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Paladins</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paladins get more spell slots, and they get them at lower levels.</li>
                    <li>Paladins get an additional casting of Lay on Hands every 5 levels.</li>
                    <li>Smite Evil is more powerful, and they get an additional casting of Smite Evil every 10
                        levels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, paladin orders no longer limit multiclassing, and they have extra abilities.</p>
                <h5>Paladin of Ilmater:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>2nd level: The paladin can cast Shield Other (which halves the damage an ally takes,
                        causing the paladin to take the other half) at will.</li>
                    <li>6th level: The paladin's healing spells and abilities heal 50% more hit points if used
                        on an ally other than the paladin.</li>
                    <li>11th level: The bonus to healing spells and abilities is increased from 50% to 100%.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Paladin of Helm:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>2nd level: While using the Guard action, the paladin and all allies within 20 feet gain
                        a +2 AC bonus.</li>
                    <li>6th level: The AC bonus from using the Guard action increases to +4.</li>
                    <li>11th level: While using the Guard action, the paladin can see through illusions as per
                        True Sight.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Paladin of Mystra:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>2nd level: The paladin gains one rank in Armored Arcana, reducing their arcane spell
                        failure by 35%.</li>
                    <li>6th level: The paladin gains two more ranks in Armored Arcana, reducing their arcane
                        spell failure by a total of 105% (allowing them to cast arcane spells with no chance of
                        failure while wearing the heaviest armor and shields).</li>
                    <li>11th level: All fire, cold, electricity, acid, and magic damage dealt by the paladin is
                        increased by 20%. This stacks with feats like Spirit of Flame. This bonus applies to
                        both spells like Fireball and abilities like Smite Evil.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Rangers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rangers get more spell slots, and they get them at lower levels.</li>
                    <li>They can gain the feats Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot at lower levels than
                        other classes, and they can gain a second rank in those feats for another attack per
                        round.</li>
                    <li>They are also able to use Set Natural Snare every 6 levels, which snares enemies for 5
                        rounds on a failed Reflex save.</li>
                    <li>Set Natural Snare is much more effective than in the original game; the save DC now
                        scales with the ranger's Wilderness Lore skill.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Rogues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rogues get +1 luck every 5 levels.</li>
                    <li>They won't have the sustained damage output a warrior has, but they'll be able to land
                        some very wicked sneak attacks (luck in IWD2 increases the chance of a critical hit).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Class Revisions also revises some of the thieving skills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pick Pockets:</strong> As in PnP, pickpocketing someone involves two rolls: one
                        to determine if you're caught, and the other to determine if you are able to take the
                        item. Any item could potentially be stolen, including equipped items (the DC depends on
                        the item slot and whether the item is equipped; stealing from one of their regular
                        inventory slots is easy, but stealing an equipped weapon is very hard, and stealing an
                        equipped suit of armor is basically impossible, with a DC of 70, on which a 20 doesn't
                        guarantee success). In addition, when you pickpocket someone, you see a list of the
                        droppable items they have in their inventory, along with the chance of stealing each one
                        and the chance of getting away with it. Items that are easier to steal and less likely
                        to get you caught are stolen first.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Open Lock:</strong> The lockpicking system has been revised to be more like
                        Baldur's Gate, in that picking locks is easier but forcing them open is harder, and
                        there isn't much variance to the roll: if you aren't able to get it open after a couple
                        of tries, you probably can't. Also, picking locks now gives you experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Disable Device:</strong> Disarming traps gives you experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Sorcerers</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorcerers will no longer hit their peak at level 20 and then experience near-zero
                        growth.</li>
                    <li>As in PnP, sorcerers can, on certain level ups, replace one of their lower-level spells
                        with another spell of the same level.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Wizards</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>As in PnP, wizards can choose two new spells to learn on each level up, which can be of
                        any spell level the wizard has access to.</li>
                    <li>Generalist wizards now gain +1 to the DC of all wizard spells they cast (Specialist
                        wizards gain +2 to the DC of wizard spells they cast of their school, but this was a
                        vanilla feature that wasn't documented in IWD2 until now).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although the inherent changes to clerics, sorcerers, and wizards aren't huge, all
                    spellcasting classes benefit greatly from some the new feats, especially metamagic feats.

                <h3>3. Looser Alignment Restrictions for Classes</h3>
                <p>Even IWD2's very broad class system can be restrictive in some ways, mostly in the lawful/chaotic
                    axis. This component loosens a few of the restrictions, allowing certain classes to be
                    compatible with more alignments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bards can be any alignment besides Lawful Neutral (previously could not be any lawful
                        alignment).</li>
                    <li>Monks of the Old Order can be any non-chaotic alignment.</li>
                    <li>Monks of the Broken Ones can be Neutral Good.</li>
                    <li>Monks of the Dark Moon can be Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, and Neutral Evil.</li>
                    <li>Paladins of Ilmater and Mystra can be Neutral Good.</li>
                    <li>Paladins of Helm can be Lawful Neutral.</li>
                    <li>Rogues can be Lawful Good.</li>

                <h3>4. Spell Revisions</h3>
                <p>This component significantly strengthens many underpowered spells. It also switches some spells
                    to lower or higher levels and grants some spells to classes that previously could not cast them.
                    Here are the main changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over 90 new spells are added to the game. These include unused spells like Dimension Door,
                        PnP spells that weren't included in the original game like Fly, Wall of Force, and Reverse
                        Gravity, spells from other games like Mantle, Stygian Ice Storm and Isaac's Greater Missile
                        Storm, as well as unusual ones like Identify Creature (a divination spell that tells you the
                        stats of the target creature) and Auril's Blessing (which increases the power of your cold
                        spells). Some of the new spells are bard-only, paladin-only, or ranger-only.</li>
                    <li>Cleric domains have better spell choices. If a spell is in-theme with the kit (e.g.
                        Moonblade and Wall of Moonlight for priests of Selune), they can cast it at a particularly
                        low level as a domain spell.</li>
                    <li>Clerics can spontaneously convert spells above 4th-level into healing/harming spells of the
                        same level, rather than into Cure/Inflict Critical Wounds. Here is the full list:</li>

                        lower-level spells by Rangers or Paladins than by Druids or Clerics (e.g. Rangers can cast
                        Fire Seeds as a 4th-level spell, and Paladins can cast Spiritual Weapon as a 1st-level spell
                        and Holy Power as a 3rd-level spell).</li>
                    <li>Magical weapons like Flame Blade and Decastave have been improved. Most of them gain bonuses
                        from Strength and proficiency (even ones that deal non-physical damage). Saving throws on
                        magical weapons and touch attacks (e.g. Snakebite poison, Slay Living instant death) now
                        have DCs that scale with the character's spellcasting ability and Spell Focus bonuses.</li>
                    <li>Spells that weaken a creature rather than disabling it have a higher DC or no save at all
                        (e.g. Deafness has no save since it simply gives 20% spell failure).</li>

                <p>In the unmodded game, spellcasters could only choose Spell Focus to empower Evocation,
                    Necromancy, Transmutation, and Enchantment spells. This component expands those four feats to

                <h3>6. Item Revisions</h3>
                <p>Normally, Icewind Dale 2's items are balanced terribly. There are just a few good items towering
                    over hundreds of almost useless magic items (e.g. items that just provide +1 Hide skill or 1/-
                    Spell Resistance). It's not even a low-magic game: you get tons of magic items, but most of them
                    are terrible.</p>
                <p>Item Revisions enhances most of the magical items in Icewind Dale 2, giving them a much larger
                    variety of useful abilities. The purpose is primarily to empower weak items rather than to
                    weaken strong items. Overall, the total number of magical items you obtain as loot in the game
                    won't change much, but those items are more likely to be useful.</p>
                <p>Item Revisions also adds many new items to the random loot tables, including powerful armor,
                    shields, rings, amulets, and ammunition. </p>

                <h3>7. Creature Revisions</h3>
                <p>This component enhances creatures and encounters throughout the game. Here are the main changes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spellcasters are given better AI and new spell selections, including some of the new spells
                        from Spell Revisions. They start combat with buffs on. They shouldn't be quite as tough as
                        Sword Coast Stratagems spellcasters, though.</li>
                    <li>Enemy clerics now use domain spells. Even clerics of enemy-only deities cast domain spells
                        (e.g. priests of Auril have spells like Ice Storm, while priests of Xvim have acid spells).
                    </li>
                    <li>Enemies use more sensible items and attacks. Aurilite rangers shoot frost arrows, mind
                        flayers drain Intelligence on hit, and large creatures have longer reach on their attacks.
                    </li>
                    <li>On Heart of Fury Mode, enemies are stronger in a variety of ways. Monsters' innate abilities
                        have higher save DCs and/or deal more damage. Spellcasters cast higher-level spells than
                        they do on normal difficulty settings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Fixes:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Harpies in Chapter 1 use their wail.</li>
                    <li>Yuan-ti Half-breed Sorceresses in the battle for Kuldahar now cast spells.</li>
                    <li>On Heart of Fury Mode, enemy monks have higher-level monk fists to reflect the fact that
                        they are higher-level. </li>
                    <li>On Heart of Fury Mode, creatures summoned by enemies now gain Heart of Fury Mode
                        bonuses.</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="xp">

                <h3>8. Better XP Progression</h3>
                <p>In most RPGs, you gain levels at a roughly constant level over the course of the game. In IWD2,
                    though, you gain XP and levels slower and slower as you progress in the game, which is the
                    biggest reason why the late game is so much less fun than the early game. This is because many
                    enemies are rigged to be a lower challenge rating than their actual level. By the time you're in
                    the Severed Hand, you might be fighting critters that are level 17 but have a challenge rating
                    of 9!</p>
                <p>This component fixes that. There are two install options. The first option sets all creatures'
                    challenge rating equal to their level, which results in extremely fast leveling as the game
                    progresses. The second option, which is the recommended version, sets CR to slightly below their
                    level after level 9. Neither option will affect early game enemies much, but midgame and endgame
                    enemies will now grant XP appropriate to the challenge they pose.</p>

                <h3>9. More Interesting Alternative to the Palisade Quests</h3>
                <p>This component offers a more exciting alternative to the quests you'd normally have to do at the
                    Palisade. When you first talk to Shawford, rather than agree to do his "special assignments,"
                    you can simply choose to stand guard at your posts until the goblins attack. This jumps you
                    straight to the Palisade battle, which will be more difficult and involve more enemies (e.g.
                    because you didn't repair the wall, and Isherwood couldn't pick off as many goblins before
                    running out of arrows). If you manage to win this more difficult battle, you get extra
                    experience equal to the experience you would've gotten for completing the quests.</p>

                <h3>10. Add Additional Ways to Progress Through Certain Areas</h3>
                <p>This component includes several changes that make certain areas more nonlinear and add some more
                    opportunities to use certain niche spells and skills.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you want to try attacking the Horde Fortress head on, you can bash open the gate to the
                        inner fortress with a Knock spell. While inside, one of the enemies drops a wardstone that
                        will open the gate to Guthma's cabin, though you could also sneak in by opening a grate on
                        the roof. With the wardstone, you can also head into Goblin Warrens from the opposite
                        direction you normally would, fight your way through, and come out the other side.</li>
                    <li>Several locks in the Ice Temple that previously required keys or the lightning machine to
                        open can be picked.</li>
                    <li>It is possible to actually fight Aeij-Kllenzr't. Taunting them off the altar will begin the
                        fight, though you can still skip the fight by banishing them with their true name. Fighting
                        and defeating them will banish them and allow you to complete the quest with some additional
                        rewards. This content requires Creature Revisions to be installed.</li>
                    <li>In the Severed Hand, the door to the bridge between the War Tower and the Wizard Tower is
                        unlocked from the start, so if you have a way to make the party fly or teleport, you can
                        reach Orrick's study by going over the gap in the bridge.</li>
                    <li>Riki no longer requires you to fight Iyachtu Xvim or make a deal with him to proceed to the
                        final bosses. However, if you didn't defeat Iyachtu Xvim or ally with him, you will have to
                        survive unkillable glabrezus while fighting the final bosses, and the bosses will be tougher
                        in the second phase because you didn't purify the radiant pool.</li>

                <h3>12. Faster Dragon's Eye</h3>
                <p>This component reduces the backtracking necessary to get through Dragon's Eye by making the
                    alchemy quests optional. You should now be able to fight your way through the third floor of
                    Dragon's Eye without having to go back to previous floors.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A powerful mind-shielding spell like Impervious Sanctity of Mind or Mind Blank can allow you
                        to pass under the Eye of Sseth without needing to become a histachii. (This is PnP-accurate;
                        Mind Blank normally protects against an Antipathy spell).</li>
                    <li>Opening the door in the third floor of Dragon's Eye no longer requires you to put poison in
                        the four pools in the area; you just have to kill Thorasskus.</li>
                    <li>The timed gate with the slime trap opens after 60 seconds rather than 24 in-game hours.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The alchemy quests can still be completed; you can still make histachii brew and poison vials.
                    These items still offer benefits: the histachii brew allows you to sneak past yuan-ti without
                    them attacking you, and the poison vials can now be used as consumables to poison your weapon as
                    per the Envenom Weapon ability.</p>

                    time travel quest, you just fight one battle to prevent Izbelah from casting Temporal Stasis.
                    The component changes some dialogs in Chapter 5 to make it clear why you're fighting Izbelah.

                    Elytharra, Zack Boosenberry, Suoma, Bered, and Sheemish. A solo wizard or a wizard in HoF mode
                    will be able to learn high-end spells and keep pace with a sorcerer. This isn't too extreme:
                    early-game vendors might have a couple of scrolls at 5th-7th level, but they won't have tons of
                    9th-level scrolls.</p>

                    slimes in Dragon's Eye aren't completely immune to physical damage, and iron golems and will o'
                    wisps aren't completely immune to magic (they still have high spell resistance, though).</p>
                <p>Elementals now have regular elemental immunities rather than undead immunities. Fiends now have

                <h3>20. More Persuasion Options</h3>
                <p>This component adds more opportunities in the game to use Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and other
                    skills in dialogue.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>SPOILERS:</summary>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the fight with Torak, a character with high enough Intimidate can potentially
                            intimidate some of Torak's minions into abandoning their leader, though it probably
                            won't work on all of them.</li>
                        <li>In the fight for Shaengarne Bridge, a character with high enough Intimidate can
                            intimidate Xuki into surrendering and dropping her gear, though the other enemies will
                            still have to be dealt with.</li>
                        <li>It's possible to make a deal with Guthma to stop his attack on the Ten Towns and finish
                            Chapter 1 without fighting Guthma, though it will require both Bluff and Diplomacy.</li>
                        <li>It's possible for the party to Bluff their way out of the fight with Thvara.</li>
                        <li>Suoma can be intimidated into telling the party of the dark treants early on, though it
                            requires you to be rather mean. Once you've rescued the children from Limha, you can
                            also persuade Suoma (using Diplomacy) to tell you of the dark treants. Either way, that
                            will allow you to fight the dark treants and move on to the Cold Marshes earlier than
                            normal.</li>
                        <li>The party can bribe Limha into freeing the children and turning them back to human form.
                            The cost is lower with higher Diplomacy.</li>
                        <li>A character with an extremely high Search or Wilderness Lore skill can potentially find
                            the exit to the Fell Wood without having to fight the Dark Treants.</li>
                        <li>Before fighting Harshom, a character with arcane spellcasting who has high enough Bluff
                            and very high Spellcraft and access to illusion spells can trick Harshom in order to
                            gain advantage in the battle in some way. The check is easier to make if the character
                            is an illusionist.</li>
                        <li>When the party first enters the mind flayer stronghold, a character with very high
                            Intimidate can intimidate the Elder Brain in response to their telepathic messages and
                            convince them to let the party leave without a fight, provided they head straight to the
                            exit.</li>
                        <li>In the yuan-ti temple in Chult, it is possible to talk with Ojaiha and organize a truce,
                            provided your Diplomacy is high enough. This will allow you to move on to the fight with
                            Cedra's forces once you return to Kuldahar.</li>
                        <li>In the Severed Hand, there is a new character in the throne room. A party member with an
                            outrageously high Bluff skill can convince them to call back Isair and Madae to the
                            Severed Hand and give you an audience, starting the final battle earlier than normal.
                        </li>
                        <li>Lastly, this component adds no fewer than five different dialogue paths to talk your way
                            out of the final boss fight. They typically require the character talking to be very
                            good at multiple pursuasion skills.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>21. NPC Core</h3>
                <p>This component allows several existing NPCs to join the party: the fighter Reig, the rogue Black
                    Geoffrey, the diviner Veira, the cleric Emma Moonblade, the troll Vrek Vileclaw, the goblin
                    Vunarg, the rogue/illusionist Zack Boosenburry, the abishai Xhaan, the sorcerer Pairi, and the
                    monk Sersa. </p>
                <p>The NPCs do have banters and interjections, but overall the production value of IWD2EE's NPCs is
                    definitely lower than the previous IWD2 NPC mod.</p>

                <h3>22. NPCs start with experience</h3>
                <p>NPCs start with the average experience of the rest of the party members. The second one makes
                    them start with a fifth of the total experience of the party.</p>
                <p>The point of the second option is to prevent certain exploits related to soloing. If you have the
                    first option enabled, you could get pretty far into the game while soloing and reach a high
                    level, and then recruit NPCs that were just as overleveled as your starting character. With the
                    second option enabled, those NPCs will be at a reasonable level regardless of the previous size
                    of the party.</p>
                <p>The first option is recommended if you aren't planning on doing any XP exploits like that.</p>

                <h3>25. Revised Battle Square</h3>
                <p>To get all the rewards for the Battle Square, one normally has to fight 25 battles per rank, to a
                    total of 250 battles. Even if the party members are powerful enough to win all the battles, this
                    is still very tedious.</p>
                <p>This component makes it so one only has to beat a rank once (with 3 or more squares) to get the
                    main reward for the rank. To get all the rewards, it will only take 30 battles rather than 250.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, this component allows you to go back to the Battle Square and finish it up in

                <p>Race Revisions revises various races and subraces, giving them abilities that they're supposed to
                    have in PnP:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Humans get 4 extra skill points at 1st level rather than 2.</li>
                    <li>Elves can detect traps even when they aren't actively searching.</li>
                    <li>Gnomes get a bonus to the DC of illusion spells they cast.</li>
                    <li>Knockdown/trip attempts against dwarves have their DC reduced by 4, as dwarves are
                        especially stable.</li>
                    <li>Drow and Tieflings can cast Darkness once per day. Drow start proficient with crossbows
                        instead of bows.</li>
                    <li>Duergar can enlarge themselves once per day.</li>

                        for being half-human; previously all their benefits and drawbacks had to do with their
                        elf/orc side).</li>
                    <li>Elves may use Weapon Finesse with large swords.</li>
                    <li>Dwarves start proficient in axes and hammers.</li>
                    <li>Rock gnomes have +2 Intelligence instead of Constitution.</li>
                    <li>Lightfoot halflings may add half their Dexterity modifier rather than their Strength
                        modifier to the damage of a sling or thrown weapon (if the former is higher).</li>
                    <li>Ghostwise halflings gain 1.5 times their Strength bonus to damage with slings and thrown
                        weapons, as one would with two-handed weapons. In addition, their stat penalty is to
                        Intelligence rather than Strength.</li>

                <p>This component makes killing enemies give the same amount of experience no matter the party's
                    level. This way, leveling up doesn't come with the dissatisfaction of enemies giving less
                    experience, and there's no incentive to delay leveling up to increase experience gain. There are
                    two options: either you can have enemies give experience equal to 25 * their challenge rating (a
                    six-character party will reach about level 15 by the end of the game), or it can be 35 * their

                <h3>29. Adjust encounter level-scaling</h3>
                <p>Icewind Dale 2 encounters often have additional enemies for a higher-level party. This component
                    has two options: you can make it so you always fight at least the version of the encounter meant
                    for a medium-level party, or you can make it so you always fight the version meant for a
                    high-level party. The higher-level versions of encounters usually just have a couple more
                    enemies or in some cases have tougher versions of enemies; they aren't impossible for a
                    lower-level party to complete.</p>
                <p>Note that this component does almost nothing in a Heart of Fury playthrough or a solo run,
                    because in those playthroughs your character(s) are usually high enough level to trigger the
                    high-level encounters anyway.</p>

                    level. It is balanced such that enemies early on will have way less HP than in the original HoF,
                    but enemies later on won't have that much less HP. This will make Heart of Fury Mode easier, but
                    also much less tedious (and Creature Revisions makes Heart of Fury Mode more challenging to make

                <p>This component allows characters to make attacks of opportunity in melee under certain
                    conditions: if the enemy steps out of your melee range, if they make a ranged attack, or if they
                    cast a spell.</p>

                <h3>39. Change the way ability scores are assigned at character creation</h3>
                <p>This component has three options. Two of them allow you to roll for stats rather than use IWD2's
                    normal point-buy system. The first one doesn't allow you to increment or decrement stats with
                    the plus/minus buttons, but you can choose which ability score each number rolled is assigned to
                    (like in The Temple of Elemental Evil). The second subcomponent lets you use the plus/minus
                    buttons.</p>
                <p>The third subcomponent lets you use the point-buy system of Neverwinter Nights, where increasing
                    a stat above a certain value requires you to spend extra points, and the minimum for a stat is
                    8.</p>

                <h3>40. Add more traps</h3>
                <p>This component adds more traps to the game, and makes certain existing traps somewhat more
                    dangerous. Don't worry; this shouldn't turn IWD2 into Durlag's Tower. The point is to add twists
                    to existing encounters and make trap-disarming skills more meaningful.</p>

            <section id="buffing">

                <h3>41. Add key bindings for automating buffing</h3>
                <p>This component adds a very fair system for automating buffing.</p>
                <p>To use it, first press the "[" button to start recording spells, then have party members cast any
                    number of spells, which must either target party members or target a point. Then press "[" again
                    to finish recording.</p>
                <p>After that, pressing the ";" button at any point will cause party members to cast the same spells
                    that were previously recorded, in the same order, targeting the same party members as in the
                    original recording. Spells that target a point will target the caster's location instead. If any
                    of the recorded spells are not memorized at the time they would be cast, those spells are
                    skipped.</p>
                <p>Pressing the "]" button will erase the recording until you do a new one.</p>
                <p>This system doesn't cheat in any way; the spells aren't cast instantly nor can you cast more than
                    one spell per round unless you have Improved Alacrity. However, it should still speed up buffing
                    somewhat and make it require less effort by the player. Once you have the spells recorded, you
                    just have to press ";" without having to scroll through spell lists.</p>

            <h2>Credits</h2>
            <p><span class="pseudo">Chris Dix</span> (She/Her) - aka <span class="pseudo">@semiticgoddess</span> - was
                the one who started the IWD2EE project and got the rest of the team together to work on it. She did the
                initial work on the first half of IWD2EE's components and did most of the writing, including NPC
                dialogue and potion descriptions.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@OlvynChuru</span> created the second half of IWD2EE's components, created all the
                new items and almost all the new spells and feats. <span class="pseudo">OlvynChuru</span> was also
                responsible for all the changes to encounters and enemy AI and most of the changes to feats, items, and
                spells, as well as the Lua functions that are called by the new opcodes.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@Bubb</span> created most of the base functions and new opcodes that open new
                possibilities for modding. <span class="pseudo">Bubb</span> was also responsible for many of IWD2EE's
                greatest quality of life improvements, including quickloot, faster loading times, and built-in
                widescreen capability.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@mrfearless</span> created the IEex loader that enables Lua functions to be run in
                IWD2.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@kjeron</span> created many WeiDU functions that are used in IWD2EE's installation
                to modify IWD2 files.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@CamDawg</span> revised some of IWD2EE's WeiDU files to run faster.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@Improbabile68</span> translated IWD2EE into Italian.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@paladin</span>, <span class="pseudo">klichko86</span>, and <span
                    class="pseudo">rytomen</span> translated IWD2EE into Russian.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">Andrii Shafetov</span> - aka <span class="pseudo">@ashafetov</span> - created
                IWD2EE's new main menu screen and the starting screens for the prologue and first two chapters.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">Igor Levchenko</span> - aka <span class="pseudo">@Igor_Levchenko</span> - painted
                the portrait for Vrek Vileclaw.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@Vertis</span> created the image for the new quickloot panel.</p>
            <p><span class="pseudo">@mleduque</span> fixed an OS-specific command in the WeiDU installation to maybe
                work on Linux.</p>
            <p>Several people on Discord, including <span class="pseudo">@Vertis</span>, <span
                    class="pseudo">@rbaker</span>, and <span class="pseudo">@IcewindDale2</span> managed to generate AI
                portraits for Reig Redwaters, Black Geoffrey, Veira, Emma Moonblade, Vunarg, Zack Boosenburry, and Sersa
                when we were having trouble finding a real artist to do the portraits.</p>
            <p>Credit goes to <span class="pseudo">Erephine</span> for allowing IWD2EE to use the animations from 1
                Pixel Productions.</p>
            <p>And lastly, credit goes to the over 300 people who playtested IWD2EE before release. Special thanks goes
                to <span class="pseudo">@Gazoo</span>, <span class="pseudo">@Firecrow</span>, <span
                    class="pseudo">@deeel</span>, <span class="pseudo">@IcewindDale2</span>, and <span
                    class="pseudo">@Fallen Prince</span> for giving extensive feedback on our Discord.</p>
