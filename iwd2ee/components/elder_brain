//NOTES
//This currently only makes a slight tweak to the Elder Brain's dialog, to make it compatible with the possibility that the party broke into the mind flayer city by force. The dialog still needs to be rigged to make sure that other creatures in the area become neutral when the brain is successfully intimidated.
