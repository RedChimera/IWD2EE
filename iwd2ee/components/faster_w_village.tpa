//NOTES

// This component introduces several new means of skipping the Wandering Village. First, the Hunter's Ghost has some new lines.
// If anyone in the party has a Diviner level or high Search or Wilderness Lore, they can claim they can get through the woods on their own, which sets a variable.
COMPILE ~%mod_folder%/dlg/50HGHOST.d~
// Second, Suoma also has new lines. The first time you meet her, you can intimidate her into telling you how to escape the woods.
// After you save the children from Limha and report to Venla, you can also use Diplomacy to get Suoma to help you earlier than normal.
// Both of these set a new variable to 1.
COMPILE ~%mod_folder%/dlg/50SUOMA.d~
// Next, we have an updated area script for the exit from the Wandering Village.
// If you use Intimidate or Diplomacy on Suoma, you should be able to fight the dark treants early.
// If you have high Search or Wilderness Lore or a Diviner in the party, you should be able to walk right to the exit.
COPY ~%mod_folder%/bcs/AR5015.bcs~ ~override~
// The latter method requires a custom script, which replicates some but not all of the effects of the normal cutscene that plays when you kill the treants.
COPY ~%mod_folder%/bcs/USWVSKIP.bcs~ ~override~

// This area file was used in a previous version, which simply made the area exit available by default.
